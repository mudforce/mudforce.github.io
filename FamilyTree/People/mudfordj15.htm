<h3>John William Francis Mudford Biography</h3>
John William Francis Mudford was born 17<sup>th</sup> November 1929 in Barry, Glamorgan, Wales. He was the spit image of his father. When I was younger, I wondered why Gran had a photo of Uncle John on her wall rather than any of her other sons. It turned out to be my Grandfather Tom who I never knew. He died before I was born.<br><br>

He married <a href="17hartlanda.htm">Anne Hartland</a> (born 7<sup>th</sup> February 1931) in St. Paul’s Church, Barry, Glamorgan, Wales on 5<sup>th</sup> March 1955.<br><br>

John Mudford worked for BP Chemicals in Barry all his working life and was an active union member, shop steward and union official. He and Anne had one daughter <a href="18mudfordi.htm">Irene</a> (born 18<sup>th</sup> July 1957 in Barry, Glamorgan, Wales), who married <a href="19owensm.htm">Mike Owens</a> (born 20<sup>th</sup> August 1951), a postman on 25<sup>th</sup> March 1978 in Windsor Road Reformed Church, Barry, Glamorgan, Wales. They had 6 children. Sadly, the second born son died aged one.<br><br>

The Owens children are:-<br>

<a href="20owensg.htm">Gareth Edward Owens</a> 28<sup>th</sup> December 1979<br>
