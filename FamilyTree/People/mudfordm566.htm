From a letter written by Sharanne MacDonald in Canada to Violet Dennett.<br><br>

&quot;Here is Mabel Mudford's story, as much as we know since she came to Canada. She was a very private person, and until she died - March 4 1988 aged 91 – we did not know she had any brothers 
and sisters.<br><br>

Grandma came to Canada and arrived at Quebec. She stayed at the YMCA and was very fond of the organization all her life. She worked as a domestic during this time. She then came to London Ontario, 
where she probably met her husband, Gerald Basil Brewer. They were married in 1919. They had one daughter Geraldine in 1920. In 1939 when Mabel was 43, Basil left her. He worked in a laundry, 
and ran away with a co-worker, a widow, whose husband was killed coming home on leave. Mabel then worked in an electronic plant and then at a printing house. In 1950 she became divorced and 
shortly after married Earl Sayers, a bachelor. They lived happily until he died in the 1960's. Interestingly, Grandma never acknowledged her marriage to Basil or the divorce - she always condemns 
divorce, as if she blocked those memories of her life out.<br><br>

Grandma had a house with Earl and kept it and then lived with Geraldine her daughter and her husband until 1982 when she resided at a retirement home until she died suddenly of a heart attack. 
Grandma was slightly deaf and had severe arthritis but certainly had her faculties in full control.<br><br>

Her daughter Geraldine died October 1986. She was in charge of programmes for the adult YMCA. She was 66. Geraldine married Leonard MacDonald and they had one son, Roderick, my husband aged 42 now.<br>

Roderick married and had two children, Tara 18 and Robert 15. Twelve years ago he divorced and 4 years ago he married me, and we have a son, Grant one year old. All the children live here 
as well as his dad."<br><br>

She left from Bristol for Quebec on the 2nd October 1914 on the Canadian Northern ship Campanello, her occupation given as Domestic.<br><br>
