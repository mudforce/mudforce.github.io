<a href="../People/137mudfordj.htm">Josiah Mudford</a> was born 1853 in West Chinnock, Somerset and travelled out with his parents 
on the &quot;Cambodia&quot; landing at Moreton Bay in 1855. They spent some time at Moreton Bay, Miller's Forest on the Hunter River 
and then settled at Cundletown before moving to Mitchell's Island.<br><br>

Josiah married <a href="../People/158dobbinse.htm"> Eliza Ann Dobbins</a>, the daughter of Samuel &amp; Caroline Dobbins, a local family, 
in 1877 in Taree, NSW, Australia and at some stage moved to Sydney where Josiah worked at Mort's Dock as a shipwright. It is believed that 
Josiah served his time as an apprentice shipbuilder at one of the shipyards on the Manning River. They lived at 16 Victoria Street, 
Rozelle (now Quirk St).<br><br>

Eliza was a sister to Susan and Caroline Jane with her parents being Samuel Dobbins and Caroline Cummings. The story goes that Harriet 
was against Josiah's marriage to Eliza as she described her as a &quot;sickly creature&quot;. Eliza lost two female children in infancy. 
Apparently Leslie told my mother that they had to help their mother a lot in the home as she was not a well person. Eliza died in 1899 
and was buried at Waverley Cemetery.<br><br>

Elsie Lillian McCaffrey (nee Mudford) of Mitchell's Island recalls &quot;Uncle Jo&quot; used to visit her dad at regular intervals but 
never for any special reason. Never did he stay longer than 2-3 days. She doesn't recall ever seeing Eliza Ann nor has she seen a photo 
of Josiah. Elsie recalls that before going to live in Sydney Josiah worked for a time helping to build the Harrington sea wall. He had 
an accident while working on the project which resulted in the loss of one of his eyes.Josiah married Ada Latham of Randwick on 19th July 
1913. Some time ater after Josiah retired they moved to a small orchard in Johnston Rd Bass Hill (near intersection of Woodville Rd and 
Hume Highway). At the time this area was referred to as &quot;Upper Bankstown&quot;. After they vacated the house at Rozelle, Leslie, 
Sarah and their family moved there and rented it from Josiah.<br><br>

My mother said they always referred to Ada as the &quot;lady up at the farm&quot; and apparently she walked with a limp. Mum also said 
that Josiah once said that he would not marry Ada until her daughter was married. I assume that Ada died before Josiah because when 
Josiah became ill he moved to 520 Blaxland Road ,Eastwood to be cared for by Leslie and Sarah.<br><br>

Josiah died 19th March 1939 at the age of 86 in Ryde Hospital and was buried alongside Eliza at Waverley Cemetery. His
