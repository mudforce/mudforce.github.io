<h3>George Tredew Mudford Biography</h3>
Born <a href="../Certificates/51mudfordgbirth.jpg"> 14 December 1892</a> in Midsomer Norton in Clutton District. His father was 
<a href="49mudfordj.htm">Joseph Mudford</a>, a farm labourer. His mother was <a href="50hillierm.htm">Mary Mudford, formerly Hillier</a>. 
Mary Jane Mudford registered his birth on 25 January 1893.<br><br>

In the 1911 Census he was boarding with the Withers family in Vobster Coleford Batch, Kilmersdon, Frome, Somerset, his occupation 
being a Tub Man below ground. The following year he <a href="../TreePics/GeorgeTreewNaval.jpg">signed up with the Royal Navy</a> for 12 
years. He started off at HMS Vivid II, the on-shore Stokers and and Engine Room Artificers School in Devenport before moving on to 
HMS Darmouth in October 1912.<br><br>

He was killed in WW1 when his ship, HMS Dartmouth was on active duty in the Dardanelles. He was one of 11 stokers killed when 
a boiler exploded during a Dardanelles Naval Attack. The <a href="../TreePics/51mudfordgwill.jpg"> Certificate of the Inspector 
of Seamen's Wills</a> sent to the next of kin, <a href="atm13.htm"> Arthur Thomas Mudford</a>, his brother, confirmed this. 
He was a Stoker in the Royal Navy. His Navy number was <a href="../TreePics/GTredewWarRecord.jpg">I. O.N. K.15068</a>. His middle 
name is a different spelling of his maternal grandfathers Christian name.<br><br>

His name appears on the Chilcompton, War Memorial<br><br>

The following data was found in the Commonwealth War Graves Commemoration register:<br><br>

In Memory of Stoker 1st Class GEORGE MUDFORD H.M.S. &quot;Dartmouth.” Royal Navy Who died aged 22 on Monday 15th March 1915<br><br>

Stoker 1st Class MUDFORD was the son of Mary Jane Forchan (formerly Mudford), of Britannia Yard, Chilcompton, Bath, and the 
late Joseph Mudford.<br><br>

Remembered with honour. In the perpetual care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission<br><br>

Commemorative Information.<br><br>

PLYMOUTH NAVAL MEMORIAL, Devon, United Kingdom Panel No 6<br><br>

The Memorial is situated centrally on The Hoe, which looks directly towards Plymouth Sound. It is accessible at all times. After the 
1914-1918 War, an appropriate way had to be found of commemorating those members of the Royal Navy who had no known grave, the majority 
of deaths having occurred at sea where no permanent memorial could be provided. An Admiralty Committee recommended that the three manning 
ports in Great Britain - Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth - should each have an identical memorial of unmistakable naval form; an obelisk
which would serve as a leading mark for shipping. The memorials consist of a stone tower supported by four corner buttresses, each with a 
lion couchant. Towards the top, the tower branches out in the form of four ships' prows. Above them are representations of the four winds, 
which in turn support a larger copper sphere symbolising the globe. The names of over 7,000 sailors commemorated on the memorial at Plymouth
 are cast on bronze panels placed on the buttresses, and the sides of the tower bear the names of the principal naval engagements fought 
 in the war and an inscription that reads:<br><br>

Note from Philip Clements (Midsomer Norton Historian) received by E-mail<br>

I notice that Shaun Mudford is your third cousin. I went to school with him as a child and because he lived at Greenhill, just behind my 
grandparents I used to see him a lot in the holidays and at weekends and had many a meal at his house. (It was the first and only time 
I had ever eaten spaghetti out of a tin - and I've never liked it since). I haven't seen him since 1968 when we went to separate schools.<br>

A couple of years ago, I was in the central library in Taunton where they have copies of the local newspaper, the Somerset Guardian 
on microfilm. I was looking for a particular story from my own family which occured in 1915 and I remember at the time seeing a picture 
from the Roll of Honour - the men who were killed in the war. It was a picture of a naval man whose name was Mudford and the reason why 
it attracted my attention was that it was the spitting image of Shaun Mudford when he was a boy. I didn't take the details at the 
time but I notice from your information that your grandfather's brother, George T Mudford, was buried at sea in March 1915 and I'm sure 
that was the picture I saw.<br><br>
