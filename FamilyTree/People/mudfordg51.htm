<h3>George Tredew Mudford Biography</h3>
Born <a href="../Certificates/51mudfordgbirth.jpg"> 14<sup>th</sup> December 1892</a> in Midsomer Norton in the registration district of Clutton in the sub district of Midsomer Norton. His father was <a href="49mudfordj.htm">Joseph Mudford</a>, a farm labourer. His mother was <a href="50hillierm.htm">Mary Mudford, formerly Hillier</a>. Mary Jane Mudford registered his birth on 25<sup>th</sup> January 1893.<br><br>

In the 1911 Census he was boarding with the Withers family in Vobster Coleford Batch, Kilmersdon, Frome, Somerset, his occupation being a Tub Man below ground.<br><br>

He was killed in WW1 when his ship, HMS Dartmouth was on active duty in the Dardanelles. He was one of 11 stokers killed when a boiler exploded during a Dardanelles Naval Attack. The <a href="../TreePics/51mudfordgwill.jpg"> Certificate of the Inspector of Seamen's Wills</a> sent to the next of kin, <a href="atm13.htm"> Arthur Thomas Mudford</a>, his brother, confirmed this. He was a Stoker in the Royal Navy. His Navy number was I. O.N. K.15068. His middle name is a different spelling of his maternal grandfathers Christian name.<br><br>

His name appears on the Chilcompton, War Memorial<br><br>

Commemorative Information.<br><br>

PLYMOUTH NAVAL MEMORIAL, Devon, United Kingdom Panel No 6<br><br>

The Memorial is situated centrally on The Hoe, which looks directly towards Plymouth Sound. It is accessible at all times. After the 1914-1918 War, an appropriate way had to be found of commemorating those members of the Royal Navy who had no known grave, the majority of deaths having occurred at sea where no permanent memorial could be provided. An Admiralty Committee recommended that the three manning ports in Great Britain - Chatham, Plymouth and Portsmouth - should each have an identical memorial of unmistakable naval form; an obelisk
which would serve as a leading mark for shipping. The memorials consist of a stone tower supported by four corner buttresses, each with a lion couchant. Towards the top, the tower branches out in the form of four ships' prows. Above them are representations of the four winds, which in turn support a larger copper sphere symbolising the globe. The names of over 7,000 sailors commemorated on the memorial at Plymouth are cast on bronze panels placed on the buttresses, and the sides of the tower bear the names of the principal naval
engagements fought in the war and an inscription that reads:<br><br>
 IN HONOUR OF THE NAVY AND TO THE ABIDING MEMORY OF THOSE RANKS AND RATINGS OF THIS PORT WHO LAID DOWN THEIR LIVES IN THE DEFENCE OF THE EMPIRE AND HAVE NO OTHER GRAVE THAN THE SEA.<br><br>

Note from Philip Clements (Midsomer Norton Historian) received by E-mail<br>

I notice that Shaun Mudford is your third cousin. I went to school with him as a child and because he lived at Greenhill, just behind my grandparents I used to see him a lot in the holidays and at weekends and had many a meal at his house. (It was the first and only time I had ever eaten spaghetti out of a tin - and I've never liked it since). I haven't seen him since 1968 when we went to separate schools.<br>

A couple of years ago, I was in the central library in Taunton where they have copies of the local newspaper, the Somerset Guardian on microfilm. I was looking for a particular story from my own family which occured in 1915 and I remember at the time seeing a picture from the Roll of Honour - the men who were killed in the war. It was a picture of a naval man whose name was Mudford and the reason why it attracted my attention was that it was the spitting image of Shaun Mudford when he was a boy. I didn't take the details at the time but I notice from your information that your grandfather's brother, George T Mudford, was buried at sea in March 1915 and I'm sure that was the picture I saw.<br><br>
