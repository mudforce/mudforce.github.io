She was the eldest of 13 children. She had ambitions to be a nurse but was persuaded by her mother to go into Service. She left home at 
age 15 and became a housemaid to Reverend Canon Clarke in Llandaff, Cardiff for 10 years. She was confirmed in <a href="../TreePics/MEASConfirm.pdf">
March 1911</a> at Llandaff Cathedral. He then moved to East Grinstead. She and the Cook/Housekeeper moved there temporarily to see him 
moved in. Her reference from Canon A T James, written on December 6th 1915, issued from The Minor Canories, Llandaff read:-<br><br>

&quot;I have very much pleasure in stating that Miss Margaret Stone has been employed as a house parlour maid by the Rev Minor Canon E T 
Clarke and myself at the Minor Canories for the last 5 years, during which time she has given us entire satisfaction and it is with very 
great regret that we are parting with her. She is a bright, intelligent and good tempered girl, and at all times punctual neat and clean 
in her work.. She is in everyway a most respectable girl and her moral character is of the highest. She is competent and careful at her 
work and at all times cheerful and willing. The only reason why we are losing her services is that Mr Clarke has taken up a Chaplaincy in 
the Army and I am also about to taking up a Commission and our house will have to be closed. From my experience of her I can strongly 
recommend her for a similar situation as I am confident she will give entire satisfaction. If I can be of assistance by answering 
any further enquiries I shall be pleased to do so&quot;<br><br>

She then became House Parlour maid for a lady in Penarth for 2 years until moving back home, which by now had moved to Mountain Ash, 
Glamorgan, suffering from kidney trouble. Once she recovered, she became a parlour maid in a house called &quot;
