<h3>Mona Evans Biography</h3>

Mona Mudford was born on <a href="../Certificates/MMBirth.jpg">7 September 1930</a> in Penyard House, on the hillside above Pentrebach, 
Merthyr Tydfil. Her birth was registered by <a href="cje5.htm"> Catherine Jane Evans</a> (Mother) on 16th October 1930. At the time, 
her father, <a href="dbe.htm">David Brinley Evans</a>, was working as an electrician at Plymouth Colliery in Pentrebach, which was, 
then still in the ownership of Powell Dyffryn. Apparently, there was a large amount of debate about her name with both her mother and 
father having different preferences. Her mum went out at the last minute and picked Mona, after a cousin on her maternal side. She was 
<a href="../Certificates/Mabap.jpg"> baptised</a> at Saron Chapel, Troedyrhiw on November 28 1930.<br><br>

Spent 1 term at Twyn Rodin School, Merthyr Tydfil. Her Mum had to walk down the hillside (no roads in place), leaving the pram 
(containing her brother, John) with 2 teacher friends, which was a daily problem. In 1936 the family moved to 2 Church View Abercanaid 
so she switched schools to Abercanaid Village School. They then moved to Gethin Place, Abercanaid. The family bought 4 Alexander Place 
in 1938, which they named “Bryn Hyfred”. Her father then moved to Merthyr Vale Pit. There was a Colliery house available there but Gran 
told him what to do with it!<br><br>

From 1941 to 1943, Mum attended Quakers Yard Grammar School that was 4 train stations away. In 1943, the family moved to 10 Dillington 
Terrace, Penrhiwciber where her Dad was working at Penryikerber Pit &amp; Mountain Ash Pit. The guy he replaced wouldn't move out of 
the official colliery house so they got this house instead. The bath was in the kitchen to start with so had a huge bedroom with a bath 
in the corner. There were 20 steps up to the back garden to put clothes out.<br><br>

From 1943 she attended Mountain Ash Grammar School. 1945 Post August Glyn Gwyn House, Bailey Street, Mountain Ash. 1951 Gwyn Fryn House, 
Tylerstown. 167 North Road Ferndale (Tylerstown &amp; Ferndale Pits)<br><br>

In 1948 she went to Barry Training College for 12 months only. She wanted to go nursing but bowed to pressure from her Mum to go into 
the teaching profession. Hated it from day 1 and it is not really clear whether she left of her own volition or went because she was 
asked!<br><br>

In September 1949 she started her nursing training at Cardiff Royal Infirmary (CRI). 3.5 years training ensued and in March 31st 1953 
she qualified as a State Registered Nurse (SRN). Worked as a Staff Nurse in theatre in CRI from April 53 then did 3 months night’s duty 
before going to Dudley Road, Birmingham in October 1954 to commence her midwifery qualification. Left there at the beginning of May 
1955 (having never liked being away from Wales) and started in Barry Maternity Hospital as a midwife trainee. Qualified in December 
1955 and did 3 months work as a midwife in Aberdare.<br><br>

Appointed March 1956. March 1957 applied to go health visiting. Signed to work for the county for 2 years and a week later met Dad. 
September 1958 passes HV Cert exam. Then worked in Bridgend for a twelve month. October 1st 1959 transferred to Barry as health visitor.<Br><br>

Got <a href="../Families/PaMaWed.htm"> married</a> on 12 noon on Saturday <a href="../Certificates/2Wed3.jpg">22 August 1959</a> at 
<a href="../../Places/Barry/Allsaints1.htm">All Saints Church</a> Barry, C in W in the Parish of Porthkerry with Barry in the County of 
Glamorgan in the Registration district of Barry. Gordon Mudford (Groom's youngest brother) was best man, whilst 
<a href="9matthewsr.htm">Rita Matthews</a>,( Bride's brother's fiancee) was the bridesmaid. Witnesses were <a href="4evansd.htm">David 
Brinley Evans</a> (Bride's father) and <a href="meas14.htm"> Margaret EA Mudford </a> (Groom's mother). Certificate on file. His 
address was given as 119 Pontypridd Road, because he had to move in to the new marital home in advance in order to qualify to marry in 
All Saints Church. Her address was given as Fernbank, 167 North Road, Ferndale. She wasn't given a profession!! The reception was at 
Barry Hotel. Entry music was Wagner's Bridal March (Lohengrin). Hyms were &quot;The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want&quot; 
(Da's choice) and &quot;Love Divine, all loves excelling&quot; to the tune Blaen wern (Ma's choice). Exit music was Mendelssohn's 
Wedding March (Midsomer Night's Dream).<br><br>

She was confirmed in Llandaff Cathedral in 1960. From 1969 to 1976 Worked part time as a health visitor in Barry until I became too 
demanding and she gave up to cope with me. Suffered loss of central vision in her right eye due to hardening of the blood vessels 
behind the eye whilst on holiday in Canada in 1991. Suffered a similar loss of peripheral vision in her left eye in early 2000 followed 
by age related macular degeneration in the both eyes which prevented her from driving. Became addicted to Talking Books and Newspapers. 
Continued to live on her own after Dad's death in 2010, until I moved in to look after her in late 2019. We enjoyed many foreign 
holidays until old age and ill health prevented safe travel.<br><br>

Died 16 February 2021 at the Heath Hospital, Cardiff of a significant chest infection, which lead to myocardial infarction and heart 
failure. Funeral at Barry Crematorium om March 3rd 2021, where her ashes were scattered.
