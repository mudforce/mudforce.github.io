<h3>Mona Evans Biography</h3>

Mona Mudford was born on <a href="../Certificates/MMBirth.jpg">7<sup>th</sup> September 1930</a> in Penyard House, on the hillside above Pentrebach, Merthyr Tydfil. Her birth was registered by <a href="cje5.htm"> Catherine Jane Evans</a> (Mother) on 16th October 1930 in sub district of Merthyr Tydfil (Lower) in the registration district of Merthyr Tydfil. At the time her father, <a href="dbe.htm">David Brinley Evans</a>, was working as an electrician at Plymouth Colliery in Pentrebach, which was, then still in the ownership of Powell Dyffryn. Apparently, there was a large amount of debate about her name with both her mother and father having different preferences. Her mum went out at the last minute and picked Mona, after a cousin on her maternal side. She was <a href="../Certificates/Mabap.jpg"> baptised</a> at Saron Chapel, Troedyrhiw on November 28th 1930.<br><br>

Spent 1 term at Twyn Rodin School, Merthyr Tydfil. Her Mum had to walk down the hillside (no roads in place), leaving the pram (containing her brother) with 2 teacher friends, which was a daily problem. In 1936 the family moved to 2 Church View Abercanaid so she switched schools to Abercanaid Village School. They then moved to Gethin Place, Abercanaid. The family bought 4 Alexander Place in 1938, which they named “Bryn Hyfred”. Her father then moved to Merthyr Vale Pit. There was a Colliery house available there but Gran told him what to do with it!<br><br>

From 1941 to 1943, Mum attended Quakers Yard Grammar School that was 4 train stations away. In 1943, the family moved to 10 Dillington Terrace, Penrhiwciber where her Dad was working at Penryikerber Pit &amp; Mountain Ash Pit. The guy he replaced wouldn't move out of the official colliery house so got this house instead. The bath was in the kitchen to start with so had a huge bedroom with a bath in the corner.

In September 1949 she started her nursing training at Cardiff Royal Infirmary (CRI). 3.5 years training ensued and in March 31st 1953 she qualified as a State Registered Nurse (SRN). Worked as a Staff Nurse in theatre in CRI from April 53 then did 3 months night’s duty before going to Dudley Road, Birmingham in October 1954 to commence her midwifery qualification. Left there at the beginning of May 1955 (having never liked being away from Wales) and started in Barry Maternity Hospital as a midwife trainee.
