He attended High St. Infants and Junior Schools but unfortunately, due to tremendous nerves, failed the 11 plus exam so went to Holton Road, Secondary Modern school. Was a fantastic boy soprano, regularly singing solos at St.Paul's church in Barry . Started work as a timekeeper/wages clerk aged 15 in 1940 for a Cardiff contracting firm. Worked for Baileys on Barry Docks until the intervention of his call up for WW2.<br><br>

Started off the war, aged 15,as a member of the local Home Guard, together with Dudley Rees. Then became a messenger for the air raid warning service. Then at 18 in 1943, was called up proper. Bad eyesight meant that the RAF was out, so went into the <a href="../TreePics/DaNavy.jpg"> Royal Navy</a>.

Did aptitude tests that ”suggested” mechanical ability (they were short of stokers!). He declined and was sent to Skegness where the telegrapher's training school was. It was a Butlins camp where he became class leader of a bunch of “ hooligans” including Scousers, Glaswegians and Bernard from Risca.<br><br>

As a leader, he had a choice after 6months of where he went next. He chose mine sweepers with combined ops and was based in Gosport. He helped with the testing of the sands of beaches in France pre the D-Day French invasion. Subsequently, on D Day, went over to the French coast with the British 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, which included the Devonshire, Hampshire, Dorsetshire, and East Yorkshire regiments, where they escorted them on to Gold beach. Was in a 70/110 ft Motor Gunboat. Were there to draw the fire of enemy gunners.<br><br>

Clipping from Barry &amp; District News kept by His mum:- Brothers in Song<br><br>
Two of Barry's leading musical organisations, as a result of recent annual general meetings, find themselves with one of two brothers as its chairman. These are the Barry Choral Society, of which Mr Arthur Mudford has been elected to the post, while his bother, Mr Gordon Mudford, continues as chairman of the Barry Male Voice Choir. Mr Arthur Mudford sings second bass for the choral society whilst his brother is one of the first tenors in the men's choir. The two brothers, together with a third, began their singing careers as boys in St.Paul's Church Choir in the years immediately before WWII, Arthur Mudford being the leading boy soloist under the direction of Mr Leslie Tusler, at that time choirmaster and organist and now, since 1952, conductor of the Barry Male Voice Choir.
