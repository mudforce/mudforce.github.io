Gideon was christened at St Mary's Anglican church at West Chinnock on 4th May 1851. He travelled out on the &quot;Cambodia&quot; ship 
with his parents John and Harriet arriving at Moreton Bay on 1st August 1855. After a time at Millers Forest near Raymond Terrace they
 moved up to Cundletown and then to the property on Mitchell's Island.<br><br>

Gideon was married in Toowoomba,Queensland to Mary Cahill where their first six children were born and later settled in the 
Taree area. It is understand he made a living as a boot maker because of the story of his disappearance which follows, and 
his <a href="../TreePics/GideonProbate.jpg">probate</a> record.<br><br>

Gideon disappeared in 1890 when he went fishing on the river one moonless night and although it is unclear as to what really happened it 
is thought that he drowned in a boating accident. The Missing Friends column of the New South Wales Police Gazette of 2nd July 1890 said:
"Cundletown.--On the 4th ultimo, Gideon Mudford, 40 years of age, of Mitchell's Island, left his residence for the purpose of fishing at 
the Old Bar. He had with him a red cedar boat, 18 feet long, painted black with Plate, colour top; and as neither he nor the boat can be 
found, it is presumed that he has been carried out to sea by the tide, or drowned."

William John, his brother, believed he had been murdered although most agree that he was last seen at Wherey's Place, a popular drinking 
spot. Possibly having drunk too much he may have fallen out of the boat and drowned. According to Mrs Effie Layton, on the night Gideon 
disappeared, Mary and the children walked down to the River with him. As he pulled away in the boat Mary called out &quot;Bring me back 
a big taylor&quot; to which Gideon replied &quot;Why are you tired of a bootmaker&quot;.<br><br>

After Gideon's death Gideon junior, William and Florence were fostered out to relatives and neighbours, Wilkes, Gilmours and Atkins 
respectively. Harriet went into service for a Thomas Cowan. Mary went to live in Sydney with Mary's sister Edith and
Sarah appears to have remained on the Island for a time. She eventually married a George Henley and was last heard of in Sydney.<br><br>

In 1896 Mary senior had a son Clarence Manning and some time later went to live with her brother in Queensland, taking with her Lizzie, 
Ruby, John and Clarence. It is believed that Ruby died about 1984. Clarence married Elizabeth Ethelbank who died on 14-1-1980 aged 82 
years and is buried at Dutton Park Cemetery Brisbane. They had four children; Joan, Ruby, Edna and John Manning. Edna is now Edna Nicol 
and lives in Brisbane.<br><br>
