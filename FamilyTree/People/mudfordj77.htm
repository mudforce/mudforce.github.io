<h3>Joseph Mudford Biography</h3>
Joseph is believed to have been born in 1794 at West Chinnock, Somerset, England. It is not known who his parents were or if he had any 
brothers and sisters. It is likely that he was the son of Joseph and Susanna Mudford (nee Wills), who married in Merriott on 31st 
December 1792.<br><br>

On the <a href="../TreePics/MudfordHayward.png">14 August 1816</a> he married <a href="78haywoode.htm"> Elizabeth Hayward</a> at West Chinnock, Somerset, England.<br><br>

Witnesses at the wedding were John Meacham and Joseph Ford. Attempts to trace Elizabeth's parents have failed although there was a Hayward 
family living in the area. They were wealthy sailcloth manufacturers and so it has been assumed that such a family would not allow their 
daughter to marry a poor sailcloth weaver such as Joseph. The fact that the witnesses at their wedding were not family members might suggest 
that the brides parents had not given their blessing to the marriage. It is believed that Elizabeth was born about 1794 and her place of 
birth unknown. The marriage records suggest she was living in West Chinnock at the time of the event.<br><br>

On property transaction documents of 1830 Joseph and Elizabeth are shown as living in South Street (now Higher Street) West Chinnock. In 
September 1833 they moved to a cottage at Meacham's Corner, Middle Chinnock, Somerset, England where they took out a lease. The cottage had 
previously been leased to Joseph and Susanna Mudford. Susanna's husband died in March 1833 and the lease then passed to Joseph &amp; Elizabeth. This house was demolished sometime between 1886 and 1914. It would appear that there were two cottages located on the lease as the cottage that Joseph moved into was described as newly erected in 1833. The main building had been divided into two and later into three.<br><br>

The <a href="../TreePics/1851Mudford77.jpg">1851 Census</a> for Great Field, Middle Chinnock, Yeovil, Somerset shows Joseph Mudford, widower, aged 57, hand loom weaver of sailcloth

Somerset<br><br>

Joseph was buried at Midsomer Norton on 12th January 1866, aged 76.(Clutton District Q1 1866 5c 591) It is believed that as he grew older 
Joseph moved to Midsomer Norton to live with his son <a href="63mudfordt.htm"> Thomas.</a> There is some doubt as to when and where Elizabeth 
died. One date suggested is 1848 at Yeovil and another date being 29th January 1850 at Middle Chinnock.
