<font size="3" face="Verdana">After leaving the confines of Southampton Waters, Aurora altered her course to the east to begin 
transiting the south coast of England. In the early morning the ship was making her way through the Dover Traffic Separation 
scheme which runs between the coats of the UK and France, and controls the movement of large amounts of shipping traffic, 
including ferries, in the area.<br><br>

By midday Aurora was passing through the gas fields following a track between the many gas and oil drilling platforms along a 
deep water route. Once through the routeing scheme in the late afternoon, Aurora exited into the North Sea and altered her 
course northwards towards Norwegian waters passing Dogger Bank to port. Dogger Bank is an extensive shoal about 60 miles to the 
east of Northumberland.<br><br>

During the last ice age the bank was part of a large landmass connecting Europe and the British Isles. 
It is a famous fishing ground and has been the site of three military actions of particular significance. In 1904, as the 
Russian Baltic Fleet made its way to the Far East, it opened fire on Britush trawlers fishing on Dogger Bank, believing them to 
be Japanese Torpedo boats.<br><br>
