<font size="3" face="Verdana">Arrived at the Mayflower Cruise Terminal, to find the car handover was very efficient. As soon as I got 
the cases out of the car, they were whisked away. I handed them the keys, they handed me a QR code printed out by a handheld device. 
Mum was offered wheelchair assistance through out the check-in process but declined, a decision she came to regret.<br><br>

We had to walk up a ramp, show our paperwork to a couple of ladies, who were handing out numbers which corresponded to a check-in time 
they had to sit and wait for. As we were in a suite, we were taken straight to the front of a check-in queue. Had to fill in a form to 
say we hadn't had a cold or D&V in the last two days, have our photographs taken digitally, and our passports checked. We were then 
given our cruise cards, which were our suite door keys, payment cards on the ship, and passport replacements when going ashore. Next 
was mag & bag security, and quite a long walk up and down ramps, and lifts until we were on board ship.<br><br>

We decided to skip the free canapes and drinks and go straight to our suite to recover from the journey. It was a lovely sunny day, so 
once we had done our practice emergency muster with life jackets, we sat on the balcony in the sunshine, drinking our free bottle of 
champagne and eating our free chocolates. Ordered our Captain's collection wine, and surprised the wine waiter by not only finishing 
our bottle with the meal, but taking another bottle back to our suite.<br>
