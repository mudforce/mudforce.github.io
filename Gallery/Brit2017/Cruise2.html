<font size="3" face="Verdana">Britannia continued across the Bay of Biscay overnight towards the North West tip of Spain. After 
embarking her pilot, Britannia continued into the Ria de Coruna and into the harbour, where she docked at Transatlanticos berth. We woke 
up in La Coruna, the provincial capital of the autonomous region of Galicia, at 8.00am, having <a href="LaCoruna.JPG"><img src="LaCoruna.JPG" width="369" height="493" title="Cl" border="0" align="left"></a>
steamed a total distance of 354 nautical miles from Southampton.<br><br>

Galicia has been inhabited by historic people for thousands of years. The Iberians were the indigenous race who were displaced by the 
Celts. Bagpipes are traditional, and some local dances bear a resemblance to Scottish reels. The Romans were next on the scene, followed 
by the Suebi and the Visigoths from Northern Europe. As the Christian resistance grew stronger, Galicia came under the sway of Asturias 
and Leon, and then part of the kingdom of Castile. It was sacked and razed by the Moors in the 12th Century, but 
had recovered sufficiently to receive John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, when he landed in 1356 to claim the crown of Castille. It was 
the final assembly point for the Armada in 1588, and just beat off an attack from Francis Drake the next year. It is known as the 
"Crystal City" because of the glass-enclosed balconies which grace the tall apartment buildings facing the harbour.<br><br> 

It has one famous landmark, the Torre or <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8bvrAKJQPYukS5CB7">Lighthouse of Hercules.</a> It is thought to 
have originated in Celtic times,and is situated on the top of the promontory. It was rebuilt in the second century A.D. and was renovated in 
1791, when Charles III gave it its present square shape. It is the only Roman lighthouse still in operation. It is, with Vigo, one of the 
ports from which it is easy to visit Santiago de Compostela. Both Mum and I had been there - Me when Interrailing and Mum when cruising on 
the Minerva with Dad. We decided against a repeat visit.<br><br>

Mum and I got off the ship and wandered into La Coruna along the Avenida de la Marina, with the glass-enclosed balconies, and along one 
of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CDFwYwdUfHV2Mz1h6">narrow streets,</a> crammed with all sorts of little shops. Once Mum was safely 
back on board, I went off again, and bought us a couple of bottles of wine to drink in our suite after dinner. The All on Board time was 
3.30pm. Just before then, the reception desk started asking for people to ring 5000 to say they were on board. By 3.35pm, a very cross sounding Captain was demanding Daniel Luna 
say he was on board. We eventually set off at 3.45pm. I hope Daniel got a good telling off.<br><br>

On the Lido deck by the pools, the <a href="SailAway.JPG">Sail Away party</a> was in full swing, with the entertainment team leading the 
singing. We could hear it from our balcony. Sweet Carolina seemed very popular. The only saving grace was there was no Agadoo or Birdie Song 
played.<br><br>

Today was a day at sea, heading south to Madeira. The activities available were itemised in the daily Horizon newsletter. The day started 
at 7.15am with a free Total Body Conditioning fitness class in the Gym on Deck 17. After that you could, amongst a host of things, 
choose:- A Silent Quiz by the Lido Pools; Adult quoits and table tennis competitions; Line dancing; Bingo; a Blackjack tournament in 
Brodie's casino; a film in the Cinema; a Corsage and Buttonhole class with the onboard Florist in the Crow's Nest or an adult colouring 
for mindfulness session. There were also ballroom dancing classes with Ian and Penny in the Crystal Room on Deck 7. Every time I read 
that, my mind was filled with pictures of Barry and Yvonne Hargreaves from Hi-Di-Hi.<br><br>

The newsletter did also have a note about sun lounger reservation. It stated:- "Out of consideration for your fellow guests, please do 
not reserve sun loungers. The only way to reserve a sun lounger is to sit on it. Book or personal items and towels will not reserve 
sun loungers. As the day progresses, sun loungers left unoccuied for lengths of time are regarded as unoccupied and other guests are 
free to use them." I was sorely tempted to test the system by removing towels from sun loungers, when occupants disappered for a smoke!<br><br>

We did have visitors on board. Rob Brydon and a film crew were filming the latest P&O TV commercial. We had been warned in advance that 
areas of the ship would be temporarily out of bounds, and given the opportunity to be extras. Mum and I declined the opportunity. In the 
early evening today, they were filming at the back of the boat on Deck 7. Rob did come around and wave to all of us on the starboard side, 
who were watching them film from our balconies.<br><br>

This evening was our second black Tie evening, and was celebrating the fact that the Senior chefs had been inducted into the 
prestigious Chaine des Rotisseurs, an international Association of Gastronomy.<br>
