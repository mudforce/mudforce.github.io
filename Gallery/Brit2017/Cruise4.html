<font size="3" face="Verdana">Next morning, by the time we had woken up, we were tied up in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, the capital of 
the second most populous and third largest island of the Canaries. Again, the original  inhabitants were subdued by the Castillian 
Spanish. Columbus and his companions heard Mass there before setting off for the New World, And again, they rebuffed an attack by 
Francis Drake. It is almost circular in shape, and is 34 miles long by 29 miles broad.<br><br>

It was quite a walk from the gangway to the port entrance so Mum stayed on board ship. There was a Columbian Tall Ship was docked 
close to us, welcoming visitors, and flying an enormous Columbia flag. Outside the port, it was very tourist-centric. The open top 
double decker hop on hop off bus was doing great business. You could pay 100 to be driven in your own taxi to most parts of the islands. Or go in a Tuk Tuck motorised scooter thing or horse drawn carriage.
The wharf area just across from the docks has been gentrified, like they've done in Liverpool. There is a big British legacy. One of 
the old port warehouses was owned by the Elder & Miller import/export business started in 1820, at the height of the cochineal boom. 
It is now a historical museum. Next door is the Science and Technology Museum, known as Museo Elder.<br><br>

Also in port was a German ship, Mein Schiff 6. It was their changeover day, with people arriving and leaving by bus most of the day, 
en-route to the airport. They had their muster drill, late at night, just before our departure. There was the usual Sail away party 
as we left at 9.30pm. Mum asked, "Are they singing Guide me O thou Great Jehovah, I had to reply "No that's ABBA Dancing Queen, but 
you were close". We had to reverse out of our berth and then swing around without hitting the container ship behinds us. I could 
imagine the pilot saying "right hand down a bit" to the bridge officers, or whatever the nautical equivalent is. As it was dark, 
we could see the red hot glowing embers that the funnels were discharging. Very pretty but not environmentally or financially 
sensible.<br><br>

We arrived in Arrecife, the capital of Lanzarote at about 8.30am, apparently. We weren't awake. The Lanzarote Tourism Board 
describes the place as "Lanzarote, an island forged by burning fire, has evolved a unique and never-before-seen landscape which 
is both lunar and cosmic". I don't know about that, but it is the 4th largest of the islands in the archipelago, and is the 3rd 
most populous. The most famous sight are the Montanas del Fuego, or Fire Mountains, situated in the Timanfaya National Park. The 
area around the Fire Mountains, the Islote de Hilario, is one of the hottest parts of the island. The ground temperature is 140 
degrees C at a depth of only 4 inches, and 2 feet down it is over 460 degrees C.<br><br>

The 15 minute walk into town was quite pleasant, via the newly built marina, but there was a free shuttle bus which I took. We were 
dropped of in a car park, where a petit train was waiting to transport you round town for a fee. I set off on foot to where I knew 
there was a big supermarket to buy some wine. The walk also took me into the non tourist part of town, which was a maze of little 
streets at all sort of angles.  Bought two bottles of Casal Mendes Rose wine, one of our Portuguese favourites, and set off to the 
main shopping street Leon Y Castillo. That led to the  Avenida La Marina, and the walk out to the 16th century Castillo San Gabriel 
Museum sitting out on the Islote de los Ingleses. The ancient access way was via the Puento de las Bolas, the drawbridge entrance. 
Wandered back to the shuttle pick up point via the Charco de San Gines marina / restaurant area.<br><br>

Lanzarote appears to be much flatter and windier than the other Canary Islands. Took Mum to front or pointy end of ship, as she 
calls it, and sat in the sun on sheltered from wind. We were on time to leave on time at 4.30pm, until the Captain announced that 
a guest was having to be   medically discharged on the ship doctor's recommendation, and we had to wait for the ambulance to arrive 
to take them to the local hospital before departure.<br>
