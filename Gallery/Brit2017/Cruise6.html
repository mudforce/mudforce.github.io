<font size="3" face="Verdana">The first of 2 days at sea. After transiting Cape St. Vincent traffic separation scheme shortly after midnight, 
Britannia altered around to starboard following the coast of Portugal towards Cape Roca. She then continued on a northerly course throughout 
the day entering the Cape Finistere traffic separation scheme and continuing on a north easterly course into the Bay of Biscay.<br><br>

It as a lovely sunny day but really quite windy. They didn't have to break out the motion discomfort bags, but the 12 noon Officer of the 
Watch report said it was blowing a north westerly Force 7, which meant that the wind was anywhere from 25mph - 40mph on the open decks, 
and we were warned to be careful when walking around the upper decks. Down by the pools on the Lido Deck it was sheltered from the wind, 
and the sun worshippers were all lying on their sun loungers. I found the best places to sit were right at the front and right at the back 
of the ship. It was very blowy. Apart from the sunshine, it reminded me of being on the Isle of Man Steam Packet boat sailing from Liverpool 
to the Isle of Man.<br><br>

This was our 4th and final, Black Tie dinner. My people watching came to the conclusion that the Ladies had run out of imagination or maybe 
run out of dress money. Most were smart but not overly dressy. We did pass one guy who was proudly wearing his medals on his white tuxedo, 
but I have to say that socks, sandals and a tuxedo is a look I don't think will catch on.<br><br>

Our special menu, had a choice of starters, soup and a sorbet, before a choice of main course and Dessert. I told Mum what the soup was, 
and she did her trick of telling me what she thought I said â€“ and she thought I'd said Willy based soup, much to the amusement of the people 
on the next table. I quickly advised her it was bouillabaisse soup. This was also the opportunity for the chefs and waiters to do their 
Parade.<br><br>

<font size="3" face="Verdana">The final day at sea, and the newsletter was reminding people to cash in their casino chips, return their 
library books, and collect their photos that had been taken on board at the various Black Tie dinners. We declined to go to the performance 
of the Britannia Guest Choir. I had heard them rehearsing during the week!<br><br>

A day of leisure, soaking up the last of the sunshine as we passed through a relatively calm Bay of Biscay. As we were in a suite, we got 
to get off the ship exactly when we wanted, rather than having to wait in a lounge for our designated disembarkation time,and after one 
last cooked breakfast and after steaming a total distance of 3,666 nautical miles, we disembarked and headed home.
