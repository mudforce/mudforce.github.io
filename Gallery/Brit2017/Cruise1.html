<font size="3" face="Verdana">Mum and I drove down to the Ocean Terminal, Southampton from Barry, arriving at about 12.30pm. We got 
Mum a wheelchair ride onto the ship, which took us to the Peninsular Restaurant as none of the cabins / suites were ready. We had a 

free buffet lunch and a couple of glasses of cava, before going to the Kashmir Suite B623. It was a different design from the one on 
Aurora, and a bit smaller in size, but with a much more modern TV entertainment system.<br><br>

We set sail at 4.30pm. There was the usual practice muster with the life jackets, in the bar area for the Sindhu restaurant. We had 
been assigned the Peninsular Restaurant as the default for our Freedom dining, where the staff were late opening up, as they had 
been mustering too. After a 5-10 minute wait, we were assigned a two person table which we managed to keep each subsequent evening. 
We used one bottle from our 12 Captain's Collection with dinner, and drank the free bottle of champagne back in the suite. Mum 
struggled with the Freedom Dining rather than set sitting concept. As people wandered in as they liked, she kept saying "They're 
late coming in". We met our Steward Ted, who delivered the chocolates and the newsletter, and our Butler Roni delivered our 
canapes, and the menu for tomorrow.<br>

<font size="3" face="Verdana">A day at sea heading down into the Bay of Biscay and the sea was lumpy. Roni, the Butler had told 
us the night before, that as suite occupants, we could have an exclusive, sit down breakfast in the Epicurean restaurant. There 
were a couple of issues with this:-
a) We were in the stern section of the ship, and the Epicurean was in the aft section, so quite a long walk, and 
b) It shut at 9.00am. Who gets up for breakfast that early on holiday? We declined our invitation. The self service Horizon restaurant was 
fine for what we wanted, and you could have breakfast there up to noon, not that we were ever that late.

The 12 noon report from the Officer of the Watch, confirmed the wind was blowing Force 8, and sea conditions were rough. Luckily Mum and I 
are good sailors, and I like it that lumpy. The pressure differential made opening the balcony doors very difficult. When we did open 
the door, the wind was shrieking around the toilet door jamb, making a dreadful noise. Eric Lanlard, Master Patissier was on board. 
For £75 you could have a hands on class with him at the Cookery Club, On our way down to the first of our Black Tie dinners, due to 
the rough sea state, the stairwells had “motion discomfort bags” available. That's sick bags to you and me. I watched the ladies 
entering the restaurant in their Black Tie dress, and, as I love to people watch, I judged the ladies attire, and put them into 1 of

    <li>Oh, that outfit suits her and it didn't cost an arm and a leg </li>
    <li>That looks like a good outfit but not on you madam  and </li>
