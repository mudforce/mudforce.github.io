<font size="3" face="Verdana">We woke up at about 8.00am as we were passing close to Monaco. We all waved at the pink palace. Border formalities 
into Italy were a farce. He didn't even want to look inside or even hold our passports. Loads and loads and loads of tunnels en route so 
scenic qualities of following the coast all the way were lost slightly. Sussed the fact that we would get into Pisa an hour later than our 
original plan but no-one was too bothered about this as we were polishing off the rest of the cheap French plonk we had with us.<br><br>

On arrival in Pisa we bought some bus tickets and caught the No. 1 bus to the Leaning Tower.It has to be the silliest building I have ever 
come across. There were tat shops everywhere selling disgusting looking models of the tower. Got ourselves a map from the tourist information 
office and headed off to look for accommodation. Got as far as handing in our passports to one but then sussed that at &#163;6 a night it was 
a bit expensive.<br><br>

We then spent ages trogging back and for on the buses (never chunkering our tickets) trying to find somewhere in Pisa that was open and not 
full. After about an hour or so we found the Hotel Galileo 200 metres from the famous Piazza dei Miracoli as the Piazza del Duomo is otherwise 
known. We got a large room for 27900 lira a night, just under a fiver each. We thought they must be used as University digs as there were 
cupboards, bookshelves, wardrobes and desks in each room. <br><br>

The beds were 3 in a row but very comfortable. The ceiling was magnificent. It was painted to make it look like a domed roof and had a pink 
flower-carrying cherub in the middle of a blue sky (with clouds) background with the chandelier being rooted in its navel. Found out by 
consulting the book that this was one of the few places they recommended in Pisa. The shower was the type where there is no shower curtain so 
the whole room has a shower as well. The water was beautifully hot and came at no extra charge.<br><br>

Food prices we found to be a little high. Obviously the struggling Italian economy in the years since we were last here has affected prices. 
We ended up with a very large 4 staggioni pizza and a pint of beer. Nasty things like unavoidable cover charges pushed up the prices.<br><br>

There were loads and loads of army types wandering around the place. 2 different types in khaki, some with feathers in Tyrolean like hats, 
some with purple berets plus a load dressed in what was obviously ceremonial dress complete with swords.They were everywhere but all seemed to 
have a girl with him.<br><br>

We had trouble paying for the meal with Visa as it wouldn't approve. Access was no good so Eli ended up paying for the meal with a Eurocheque. 
Eli needed some change for the phone so she asked to buy a bottle of wine for &#163;1.25. Turned out to be a quarter bottle of very nice 
Chianti. Decided that in future we must buy wine from shops not bars.<br><br>

Played a hand of contract whist then Jon and I went to bed whilst Eli phoned home. Apparently she got enough time to say "Hello, I'm in Pisa" 
and that was it. Various messing around activities ensued then a good nights sleep was had by all.
