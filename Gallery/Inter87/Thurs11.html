<font size="3" face="Verdana">We were up bright and early, paid up for the night and headed straight to Tholon beach for a while. We were almost alone on the beach so nude swimming and sunbathing ensued until 10.45am. <br><br>

At that point we headed back for a shower, put our clothes back on and were on the road by 12.00pm. Well, actually the other way around!<br><br>

Our next destination was the ancient Greek site of Olympia, the site of the Olympic Games in classical times or Olymbia as it was shown on the road signs. This is a different from Mount Olympus which is where the Olympic flame is actually lit. <br><br>

We got our timing a little wrong and arrived at the site at absolutely hottest part of the day. The site was huge and relatively well preserved and once again excavations were underway. Jon had to buy an entry ticket for the first time as his invalid International student card was spotted.<br><br>

In the sun the heat was almost unbearable and the lobster impressions my legs were doing didn't help matters. Our sightseeing was planned piece of shade to piece of shade. The only exception was the outing into the original Olympic stadium to take a photo which had to be done in the heat of the sun.<br><br>

We decided it was too bloody hot to visit the museum (despite the entrance fee being included in our tickets) and headed back to the car for a drink. <br><br>

Headed off on the main road to Patras. As Greek roads go it was a really good road and both Jon and I had difficulty keeping awake.<br><br>

We tried to stop somewhere for a swim before getting to Patras by disappearing down little dirt tracks but for the most part 
unsuccessfully. Eventually we found a "beach". It was a realy narrow strip of "sand" right by the roadside. The water was warm and 
we couldn't tell if the scum on the water was natural or chemical. <br><br>

The proximity of the road and the cruisers on their polluting mopeds made it a bit of a fishbowl so we went off for a beer instead 
(when we could find somewhere where they'd get off their backsides and serve us).<br><br>

Driving through Patras itself was interesting to say the least. First set of traffic lights we'd seen. There is no amber light and 
unless you set off before the lights change, you get beeped.<br><br>

We followed the signs to Athens as a way of getting out of town in the right general direction of the village we were looking for 
but soon found ourselves on a dual carriageway. Took a turning off to the right and as a result ended up deep in the ferryboat area.<br><br>

Headed back towards the Athens road and more by luck than by judgement saw a sign for Kato Kastritsi, the village where Jon's 
acquaintance, Dinos lives. When we got there the address we had wasn't much use, just Dinos Christodoulous and the village name. 
We drove through the village which was very spread out on a hillside with loads of dirt tracks.<br><br>

Two abortive attempts to ask directions from locals lead us to using a guy's phone to ring Dinos. He drove down to where we were 
and showed us the way to his house. The house is fantastic. It was built from the proceeds of the sale of two plots of land near 
Delphi which had been left to Dinos by two childless uncles.<br><br>

The house has sliding doors which go into walls. Numerous patio areas and gorgeous views which gave us a great sunset. We were 
made very welcome and given icecold apple juice drinks. I had a shower and sat and chatted to Dinos whilst his wife, Katy and Jon 
took Black the dog for a walk.<br><br>

We then had greek schnapps before the evening meal because I don't much like Ouzo. The schnapps was home brewed, very strong and 
very nice. Apparently, in Greece, you are allowed to distill your own liquor if you own a vineyard. <br><br>

We had a great dinner accompanied with 3 or 4 bottles of wine and finalised with a glass or 2 of Greek brandy. Dinos complimented 
me that I was the first British person he's met who knew anything at all about politics. (We were discussing Maggie and the 
election plus Papaandreous and the American bases).

We went to bed very tired and just a little drunk. A proper bed for once made a very pleasant change.<br><br><br>
