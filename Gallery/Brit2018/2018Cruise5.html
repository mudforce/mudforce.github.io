<font size="3" face="Verdana">Today, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YzLTkm1U2z3aW3dP9">we woke up in Eivissa or Ibiza Town.</a> According 
to the newsletter we had arried at 9.ooam. There was a bit of a walk to the shuttle buses that took us into town, and an enormous gap between 
the low pavement and the high step of the bus. Mum's little legs would not have coped. Luckily, she decided to stay on the boat. We were 
dropped off at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CUaYR6y8w9ySDF6k6">Port/Marina</a>, which was very busy, with departures and 
arrivals of ferries to the other Balearic Islands, and the Spanish mainland, Dénia, near Alicante and Barcelona.<br><br>

Eivissa is the capital and the largest city on the island of Ibiza. Since its foundation some 26 centuries ago it has been influenced by the 
rule of Cathagians, Romans and Arabs. The newer part of the town at the harbour level is full of shops, bars and restaurants, and in the 
summer, clubs, especially gay ones. There is a modern <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K2WEVvEKWEfCicis9">
harbourside boulevard</a>, and further inland, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/82uMBfN1W5h74hCr9">narrow winding streets</a>.<br><br>

Perched on a small mountain next to the sea and overlooking the town is the fortified old town of Dalt Vila, a UNESCO World Heritage site. 
Originally called Ibosim and founded by the Phoenicians, Dalt Vila has been added to by successive occupiers and was once one 
of the most important coastal cities in the Mediterranean. The last addition was the Renaissance defensive walls that surround it, 
which Kings Charles I and Philip II of Spain had constructed to defend against the French and the Ottomans. <br><br>

The dramatic main entrance gateway is up a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8f1egRmewJToutj17">slope,</a> traversing a stone drawbridge 
through the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ubJJxz8rJGZK5FE1A">Portal de Ses Taules</a> entering into an ancient cobbled stone courtyard.
Apparently, the views from the top are great, and the Catedral de Santa María de las Nieves (Cathedral of Our Lady of the Snows)and Castell 
d'Eivissa are worth a visit, but it was very hot, and I didn't want to leave Mum on her own for too long, so I opted to stay on the lower 
level, walking all the way along to the breakwater, from where you could see Britannia at her berth.<br><br>

Back on board, we had a fabulous view of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rBzgdvChqGnVcn5F9">Old Town</a> perched on the hill.<br><br>

The evening enertainment, which we didn't bother with, included An Evening at the Races, an interactive video Horse Racing event, and in the 
cinema, the film, Churchill.<br><br>
