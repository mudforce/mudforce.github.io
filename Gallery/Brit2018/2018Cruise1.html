<font size="3" face="Verdana">Mum and I arrived in plenty of time to embark and get a wheelchair ride for Mum. This time our suite was 
ready for occupation and we were in the suite in no time at all. Mum was amazed we were already there, and not waiting in a lounge or 
restaurant. We sailed on time, and had to go through the usual emergency drills - lecture on the ship signals and putting on the life-jackets. 
The difference this time was that we did it in the cinema. That's the first and last time we went in there.<br><br>

Dinner was as per last time, freedom dining in the Peninsula restaurant. The main difference with this trip was the ban on bringing alcohol 
on board that had been bought on shore. Well, a ban on drinking it on board without incurring an exhorbitant corkage fee that made it just 
as expensive as buying a bottle of wine on board. Having had prior warning, Mum and I had brought on board in Southampton, as allowed, a 
litre of Bombay Sapphire gin each. We ordered a bottle of wine with dinner each night from our Captain's collection vouchers, bought with 
our on-board spending allowance, and then had gin and tonic with ice and lemon back in our suite. We bought the tonic on board, and got our 
butler to bring us the ice and lemon each evening, when he brought the canapes.<br><br>

time.<br><br>
