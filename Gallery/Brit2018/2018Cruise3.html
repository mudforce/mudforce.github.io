<font size="3" face="Verdana">Woke up this morning and we <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/TudF5Y8iTm3KXyDy5">had arrived in Cadiz. </a>
According to the newsleter we were due to have docked at 9am.This being our second visit in a year, I decided to see a different part of 
Cadiz. Instead of heading across the peninsula towards the cathedral, I turned right, away from the main tourist areas, and just wandered.<br><br> 

I first came across <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/opP7e9hVQpyoNuVHA">Plaza de San Antonio.</a>  It was originally called Campo de la 
Jara, because the well of the same name was located in its vicinity, which for a time supplied the city with drinking water. From the 
middle of the seventeenth century the square took its current name when the hermitage dedicated to Saint Anthony was erected there. This 
square stands out for having proclaimed the Constitution of 1812, and for being the scene of the bloody repression of the liberal movement 
of 1820.<br><br>

Next up was <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/uksePNfmuQC6Fmzt9">Plaza El Mentidero.</a> This Plaza also had a prominent place during the 
promulgation of the Constitution of Cádiz, since the second public proclamation of the same took place here on March 19, 1812. That took me 
to the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Fg2g6ymX7fHc1sY37">Parque Genovés Botanical Gardens.</a>This historic park, situated at the very 
end of the peninsula on the waterfront, dates back to the end of the 18th century. It was enlarged in the 19th century and many more trees 
were planted, at which time in became known as “Paseo de las Delicias”, garden of the delights. Then in the late 19th century, it became a 
botanical garden under the direction of Eduardo Genovés y Puig.<br><br>

From there I headed back towards the Port, along <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/WFz2TX25FJV1Tj428">Paseo de Carlos III</a> to the 
Baluarte de la Candelaria. It was built in 1672, taking advantage of a raised area of ground. Protected by a strong wall which also serves 
as a breakwater, its cannons controlled access to the port. It has served as barracks, engineering school and centre for the army's carrier 
pigeon division.<br><br> 

I passed <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/UsJL4aSVVkmhmmRD8">Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Carmen y Santa Teresa.</a> It was built in a 
Baroque style and the works were completed in 1762. The façade stands out on the outside, with two Americanist bell gables, and the image 
of Nuestra Señora del Carmen. There was also <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/eRvxCuLGUaeiZFN6A">Alameda Apodaca y del Marqués de 
Comillas Gardens.</a> Spent the afternoon soaking up the sun on the balcony.<br><br>
