<h3>Bryn Hafren Reunion </h3>

<p>In September 1973, Bryn Hafren Comprehensive School for Girls, Barry, Vale of Glamorgan opened its doors and accepted pupils for the first time. The Grammar School and Secondary Modern had been combined to form the new Comprehensive school for the female half of Barry. 14 classes of about 30 girls started their secondary education at the Lower School (the ex-grammar school building on College Road) before transferring to the Upper School (purpose built building  on Merthyr Dyfan Road) at the end of their second year.</p>
<p>These pupils left school between 1978 and 1980 depending on the exams they were taking. They all turned 40 years of age during the academic year 2002/2003. On 27th April 2002, approximately 120 of this first year intake met up again at the Mount Sorrel Hotel in Barry.</p>
<p>The event was a tremendous success. Massive thanks to all who arranged the evening. All that was required to make the evening a fantastic event was a buffet dinner and memories revived.</p>
<p>I took a few photographs at the reunion. The links to them are over on the right. I've also found a couple of school picture from a few years further back in time. Anyone looking for images from Romilly Infants and Junior Schools, Barry circa late 1960's see the bottom links on the right.</p>
