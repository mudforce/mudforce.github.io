Mum, Dad, Jean and I went on a Page and Moy tour to France. We flew in to Toulouse and stayed in Albi. We had a free day in Albi so had a 
good look around on foot. After a coffee/whie wine in a cafe in the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/2eB6wrrVo1nGHLGH6">Old Quarter</a>, 
Mum, Jean and I went for a look in the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Cecilia, also known as <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bEJxfEKpVmn5zDH3A">
Cath&eacute;drale d'Albi</a>. It was built in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade. The exterior resembles a fortress, but the interior 
is lavishly decorated in the Toulousian or Southern French Gothic. It was begun in 1282 and was under construction for 200 years. It is 
claimed to be the largest brick building in the world. We realsised there was some sort of service on, so we sat down quietly in the back, 
only to find ourselves at a funeral. We left as quickly and unobtrusively as we could.<br><br>

From there we made our way down towards the River Tarn and the two bridges, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qzvt1nP2pGwi27nw8">Pont 
Vieux and Pont Neuf</a>. In the 12th century, Albi was at an important crossroads linking the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, 
the Basque country, Toulouse, Lyon, Catalonia and Paris. As a point of passage, the Pont Vieux was able to levy a toll. From 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/myL1vWefXRosDZXM6">this bridge</a>, there is are great views of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/t5oyiKSM6JfE9kV59">
The Palace of the Bishops of Albi</a> or <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hbsGvKyXurApKe2u5">Berbie Palace</a>, which overlooks the 
Tarn below the Cathedral and now houses the Toulouse-Lautrec museum.<br><br>

Our first trip took us to the Ville Bastides of the area. Bastides are fortified medieval towns. Some of the first bastides were built 
under Raymond VII of Toulouse to replace villages destroyed in the Albigensian Crusade. Almost 700 bastides were built between 1222 and 1372.
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yBmShWgW5p7348Fz8">Bruniquel</a> which includes the Ch&acirc;teau de Bruniquel was our first stop. Next
up was the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aHbyhBZxw87sRw276">Ch&acirc;teau de Mayragues</a>.It is part of a wine estate of 
biodynamically cultivated vines. The castle, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/G7zjBmYFcCr4s2S48">a former fortified house</a>, built on a 
rocky outcrop, was founded in the 12th century, extended in the 17th century, and restored from a state of ruin in 1980. We also visited
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DTvHQZey6vsifNsD9">Ch&acirc;teau de Najac</a> or the royal fortress of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/T5R6tP1w1QcEMrENA">
Najac </a>is built at the summit of a hill formed by a loop of the river. We also went to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/P3JwMu5NXCu7uuae8">
Cordes-sur-Ciel and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/T5Gm4hZ849NznF817">Castres</a>. The former is thought to be the first of the bastides 
of Southwest France.

The next day was a trip to Cit√© de Carcassonne<br><br>
