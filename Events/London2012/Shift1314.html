I left the hotel at 2.30pm to drive to Newbury Park Tube. It looked full when I got there but I managed to find an empty spot after a bit. 
Arrived at FDO an hour early so sat down stairs, read my paper and watched the Olympics on the TV. Saw the Louis Smith

I decided to have a day of sightseeing in central London. I was only supposed to use my Gamesmaker Oyster card whilst in uniform, but decided 
noone was likely to challenge me. First stop 

Emirates Airline and London Eye

For the first time Epping Station let me down. The car park was full when I tried to park at 2.00pm. I headed off towards Newbury Park with the 
idea of checking out Debden Station car park en route. Fates were conspiring against me as there was an accident of the road out of Epping and 
we crawled through with the police direting traffic.
There was space in Debden so I arrived at FDO in plenty of time at 3.30pm. I was asked if I would drive an MPV and I said yes so I was assigned 
to the Aqua group. One Cajun Chicken ciabatta later and with a standalone SatNav signed for we were upstairs watching the Football final at 
Wembley. One of our number had used the SatNav before and gave us all a tutorial. Seemed simple enough to use. At 4.15pm Aqua were tasked to 
go to Wembley. Seemed a litle late to be sending us but off we went. Tried to use the SatNav on the dash but it kept falling over so It had to 
go on the windscreen which made it difficult to reach.
