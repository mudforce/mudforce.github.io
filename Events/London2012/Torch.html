<h1><font size="5" face="Verdana">Olympic Torch Relay</font></h1>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">Saturday 26th May 2012</h1></font></i>

<font size="3" face="Verdana">Up and about at 7.30am, out of Mum's back garden door and up the back lane to St Nicolas Road to wait for Torch relay. More people were there than I expected. First up in the Torch Relay were the police motorcycle riders. First one parked in the road. Then he moved on to the roundabout by All Saints and 2 more took his place. Then came the publicity vehicles trying to whip up the excitement with load music and a woman on the tannoy shouting Hello Barry, the torch will be hear in 5 minutes. That proved a touch optimistic.<br><br>

First up was a large Samsung Lorry. Next along was the Coca Cola vehicle and finally we got a Lloyds TSB truck. After a bit a bus appeared, again with motorcycle riders and a black guy got off by the flats wearing the naff torch relay white tracksuit carrying a torch. The bus moved on with the remaining torch carriers and torches. The torch bearers family were waiting for him and gathered around him excitedly. One of the motorcycle outriders fell off his bike up by All Saints and got one of the louded cheers of the day.<br><br>

A few more motorcycle outriders heralded the actual arrival of the torch. Plus there were a couple of the accompaniying Met Police on pedal bikes. The guy must have thought he was going to have a nice flat day at the seaside. As he puffed past he asked "Have you got any more hills in this town?"". In his defence he had just cycled all the way up Ship Hill and it was still up hill all the way to Romikky Schools.<br><br>

The large vehicle with the press on appeared at the top of the hill so I had to move to the opposite side of the road to see the Torch Kiss. The black guy who turned out to be a granddad from London jogged his way passed us with his family running alongside taking pictures. It was a surprisingly emotional moment to see the torch pass by and there were loads of people clapping and cheering. Followed Viv and Alan back down to the house. Mum had been sat with the patio door open and heard the women on the tannoy so felt a lttle part of it.<br><br><br>
