<font size="3" face="Verdana">Got up at about 9.3apm and loaded up with full breakfast. I also made a toasted bacon butty to have for lunch. I was spoilt for choice with Olympic sport to watch on day one of the actual sport. Agreed with the cleaning lass that my room didn't need cleaning but I needed milk and biscuits. Was disappointed that Cav didn't win the cycle road race. Decided to go to the Olympic Park for a good wander around before my 10pm shift start. Epping Tube car park was busy for a Saturday afternoon. Lots of other people were using it as a park and ride.<br><br>

I arrived at Stratford at about 6.30pm. there were crowds and crowds of people everywhere. I sauntered towards the Aquatics Centre, Orbit and Stadium before heading off right to the rest of the park. I went past the London 2012 Megastore, the BBC studio on top of the shipping crates, World Plaza and loads of food/drink outlet. A strange red building called the Coca-Cola Beat Box supposedly "fused experimental architecture, sport, music and technology to create a stunning multisensory experience". The velodrome does look like a Pringle and the Basketball arena is a lot further away from the Stratford entrance than people have allowed for. The Olympic Park is bigger than you think and takes a while to get across.<br><br>

I got as far as the Park Live big screen area which was at the Eton Manor/Riverbank Arena end of the Park. Saw the Pringle Velodrome and Basketball Arena from afar. Got to FDO as about 9.15pm. Food wasn't served until 9.30pm which turned out to be a slice of pizza. Silver Team turned out to be made up of kindred spirits. Whilst Teams Yellow and Teal sat almost silently waiting for their assignments, our table was full of raucous laughter. The despatcher said he wanted to stay up with us as we were having such a fantastic time. the best part came when I showed everyone that the right hand side pocket was what was to be used to fold the jacket into. None of the men had worked this out so competitive jacket folding ensued. We decided we should challenge the other depots to a timed competition.<br><br>

Team Teal were assigned to Eton Manor which caused much sniggering on our table. We were tasked one by one to go to the car park to take home volunteers. My first trip was to Crystal Palace to take home a scheduler who used to work for the BBC. I was tasked back to Eton Manor but called back to FDO to take a driver home to Wimbledon. He was actually parked close to Southfields Tube so I didnt see the All England Club. Was tasked back to Eton Manor so requested a recce trip to the Olympic Village.<br><br>

The Olympic Village VSA is Alma Street which is not on DORS. If you use the postcode on the ordinary SatNav you have to ignore quite a few of the instructions. You can only get in off the Leyton High Road. Luckily I recognised the way in as the one we had used on our first training day. It was well worth making the trip as the way in is not obvious. The VSA was not as picky as the rest. Didn't want the bonnet searched and I didn't have to mag n bag. The Welcome Centre entrance suddenly became obvious. The entrance to village was not so obvious. It's a gap in the fencing with a cone across the entrance. there was nowhere to park up as all the cars used by the countries in the cycle road races where there with their cycle racks on the roof.<br><br>

Called back to FDO. Went in to get a cup of coffee and drank it parked up on P2 of the car park. Read some of my book. At just gone 6.00am people were being let go home. I asked for an early finish and was allowed to go.
