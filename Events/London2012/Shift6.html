<font size="3" face="Verdana">Got up at about 9.3apm and loaded up with full breakfast. Made a toasted bacon butty to have for lunch. Spoilt for choice with Olympic sport to watch on day one of the actual sport. Agreed with lass that room didn't need cleaning but I needed milk and biscuits. Disappointed that Cav didn't win the road race. Decided to go to the Olympic PArk for a good wander around before my 10pm shift start. Epping Tube car park was busy for a Saturday afternoon. Lots of other people using it as a park and ride.

Arrived at Stratford at about 6.30pm. Crowds and crowds of people everywhere. Sauntered towards the Aquatics Centre, Orbit and Stadium before heading off right to the rest of the park. Went past London 2012 Megastore, the BBC studio on top of the shipping crates, World Plaza and loads of food/drink outlet. Strange red building called the Coca-Cola Beat Box supposedly "fuses experimental architecture, sport, music and technology to create a stunning multisensory experience". The velodrome does look like a Pringle and the Basketball arena is a lot further away from the Stratford entrance than people have allowed for. The Olympic Park is bigger than you think and takes a while to get across.

Got as far as the Park Live big screen area which was at the Eton Manor/Riverbank Arena end of the aArk. Saw the Pringle Velodrome and Basketball Arena from afar. Got to FDO as about 9.15pm. Food wasn't served until 9.30pm which turned out to be a slice of pizza.

Silver Team turned out to be amde up of kindred spirits. Whilst Teams Yellow and Teal sat almost silently waiting for their assignments, our table was full of raucous laughter. The despatcher said ne wanted to stay up with us as we were having such a fantastic time. Best part came when I showed everyone that the right hand side pocket was what was to be used to fold the jacket into.

Team Teal were assigned to Eton Manor which caused much sniggering on our table. We were tasked one by one to go to the car park to take home volunteers. My first trip was to Crystal Palace to take home a scheduler who used to work for the BBC. Was tasked back to Eton Manor but called back to FDO to take a driver home to Wimbledon. Was actually parked close to Southfields Tube so didnt see the All England Club. Back to Eton Manor so requested a recce trip to the Olympic Village.

The Olympic Village VSa is Alma Street which is not on DORS. If you use the postcode on the ordinary SatNav you have to ignore quite a few of the instructions. You can only get in off the Lyton High Road. Luckily I recognised the way in as the one we had used on our first training day. It was well worth making the trip as the way in is not obvious. The VSA was not as picky as the rest. Didn't want the bonnet searched and I didn't have to mag n bag. Welcome Centre entrance suddenly became obvious. Entrance to village was not obvious. It's a gap in the fencing with a cone across the entrance. Nowhere to park up as all the cars used by the countries in the cycle road races where there with their cycle racks on the roof.

Called back to FDO. Went in to get a cup of coffee and drank it parked up on P2 of the car park. Read some of my book. At just gone 6.00am people were being let go home. I asked for an early finish and was allowed to go.
