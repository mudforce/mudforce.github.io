<font size="3" face="Verdana">Got up at about 9.30pm and loaded up with full breakfast. I also made a toasted bacon butty to have for lunch. 
I was spoilt for choice with Olympic sport to watch on day one of the actual sport. Agreed with the cleaning lass that my 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ctStvyQyjZDb4Kks9">room </a>didn't need cleaning but I needed milk and biscuits. Was disappointed that 
Cav didn't win the cycle road race. Decided to go to the Olympic Park for a good wander around before my 10pm shift start. Epping Tube car 
park was busy for a Saturday afternoon. Lots of other people were using it as a park and ride.<br><br>

I arrived at Stratford at about 6.30pm. There were <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/S112ZhwWL63LBYyb9">crowds and crowds </a>of people 
everywhere. I sauntered towards the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/sSQMHrBAPQqLRDzs9">Aquatics Centre,</a> <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CmDjg8viAm8WucXB6">Orbit </a>and Stadium before 
heading off right to the rest of the park. I went past the London 2012 Megastore, the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/deCS9dcSnykuGhgV6">BBC studio</a> on top of the shipping crates, World Plaza 
and loads of food/drink outlets with seating by the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YgDqQ5cEt7k24pQz5">Copperbox.</a> A strange red 
building called the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FTzcrWSJDhpNKkaT6">Coca-Cola Beat Box</a> supposedly "fused experimental 
architecture, sport, music and technology to create a stunning multisensory experience". I got as far as the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PoUrtSrpomn5RDw99">Park Live big screen</a> area which 
was at the Eton Manor/Riverbank Arena end of the Park. Saw the Velodrome and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/EZK5CNtHeTUZgFpP6">Basketball Arena</a> from afar.The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4DPfFsgPfwr4D7UH6">velodrome </a>does look like a Pringle 
and the Basketball arena is a lot further away from the Stratford entrance than people have allowed for. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Jxx7GypHX7751pnCA">Olympic Park </a>is bigger than you 
think and takes a while to get across.<br><br>

Got to the FDO at about 9.15pm. Food wasn't served until 9.30pm which turned out to be a slice of pizza. Silver Team was made up of kindred 
spirits. Whilst Teams Yellow and Teal sat almost silently waiting for their assignments, our table was full of raucous laughter. The despatcher 
said he wanted to stay up with us as we were having such a fantastic time. The best part came when I showed everyone that the right hand side 
pocket was what was to be used to fold the jacket into. None of the men had worked this out, so competitive jacket folding ensued. We 
decided we should challenge the other depots to a timed competition.<br><br>

Team Teal were assigned to Eton Manor which caused much sniggering on our table. We were tasked one by one to go to the car park to take 
home volunteers. My first trip was to Crystal Palace to take home a scheduler who used to work for the BBC. I was tasked back to Eton Manor 
but called back to FDO to take a driver home to Wimbledon. He was actually parked close to Southfields Tube so I didnt see the All England 
Club. Was tasked back to Eton Manor so requested a recce trip to the Olympic Village.<br><br>

The Olympic Village VSA is on Alma Street which is not on DORS. If you use the postcode on the ordinary SatNav you have to ignore quite a 
few of the instructions. You can only get in off the Leyton High Road. Luckily I recognised the way in as the one we had used on our first 
training day. It was well worth making the trip as the way in is not obvious. The VSA was not as picky as the rest. Didn't want the bonnet 
searched and I didn't have to mag n bag. The Welcome Centre entrance suddenly became obvious. The entrance to village was not so obvious. 
It's a gap in the fencing with a cone across the entrance. There was nowhere to park up as all the cars used by the countries in the cycle 
road races were there with their cycle racks on the roof.<br><br>

Called back to FDO. Went in to get a cup of coffee and drank it parked up on P2 of the car park. Read some of my book. At just gone 6.00am 
people were being let go home. I asked for an early finish and was allowed to go.
