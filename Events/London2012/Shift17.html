<font size="3" face="Verdana">My final shift. My final day in London, so I decided to start early with some sightseeing. First up was Paternoster 
Square, which is close to St. Paul's Cathedral. The plaza includes the 75ft tall <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rLo2paQgXweu5u3L8">Paternoster 
Square Column,</a> which serves as a ventilation shaft for a service road that runs beneath the square, the bronze Paternoster (also known as 
Shepherd and Sheep), <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8KfuDxwjXeFnhTJF8">Temple Bar Gate</a>, a Wren-designed stone archway constructed 
between 1669 and 1672 on Fleet Street at Temple Bar (the historic western ceremonial entrance to the City), and relocated at a cost of £3m, plus
the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/32KR7RcsN67osmtUA">Angel's Wings sculpture.</a><br><br>

From there I wandered past a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/2Q1ho1t2bxqUxLYq9">telephone box Wenlock</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/u8xDKHtncqvRAWZq6">
Paul's Cross Memorial Statue</a> in St Paul's Churchyard, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LWFYcRcfWT7MNxNo6">St.Paul's Cathedral</a> and 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/eToKZy38TDNta5Tr8">St Augustine Watling Street</a>. I headed down Peter's Hill towards the river and the 
Millenium Bridge, where I passed a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dHi6uQS5RhkJmsqE8">Mandeville.</a> I crossed the Thames over the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/shprPULDou663PhK7">Millenium Bridge</a>, from which you can see <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/m2FB478Vcdw5bBT26">
Tower Bridge (with its rings), The Shard</a> and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JaWdhEXrsXPQf94Z6">Globe Theatre.</a><br><br>

Back on the St. Paul's side of the river, I headed towards <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4JkYUzPiGWq5h4dM8">The Royal Exchange</a> with 
the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/46opzeE7xK1uJRXW8">War Memorial</a> outside and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/N5qf5RbqFgpx2YRZ8">
The Bank of England</a>. From there I came across <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KKbsHNmkWWrptknA8">Leadenhall Market</a>, which was used 
as Diagon Alley in the Harry Potter films. Next stop was down towards the Tower, and I actually went into the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1LPdX49HEQjWaXKU7">
All Hallows by the Tower Church</a> rather than sitting outside it to have lunch. Tubby Clayton, the Anglican clergyman who founded the Toc H
movement in WW1 was the Vicar here for 40 years. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8F3tuLeGAgcQmtMt9">Toc H Lamp of Maintenance</a> 
is in the Lady Chapel, and there is a lovely <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9PcRRRWLQQuv2F4N8">embroidered seat cushion.</a> I also took
the time to look at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kESqsfFrpMpntqfRA">Merchant Navy & Fishing Fleets Tower Hill Memorial</a> that I 
have <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/gooWz1UPEFjCz51Q7">walked past</a> so often.<br><br>
