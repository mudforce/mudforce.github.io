<font size="3" face="Verdana">I decided to have a day of sightseeing in central London. I was only supposed to use my Gamesmaker Oyster card whilst in uniform, but decided 
noone was likely to challenge me, so went fot it. I managed to park up at Epping, despite not being there very early. POETS day or a long 
weekend vibes obviously. Tube to Stratford on the usual Central line, then a swap to the Jubilee Libe to Canning Town then a very quck trip on 
the DLR to Royal Victoria. That left a quick walk to the Royal Victoria Dock to the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qoK6Bj4fYWSZmfmUA">
Royal Docks Terminal</a> of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Zjzd8UweRcqTGMLf6">Emirates Air Line.</a><br><br>

Thank goodness the weather was good. No wind to cancel the trip and sunshine to show up the views, of which there were a lot. The 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/H7UQE1bXYPZgsgdDA">02,</a> or as we have to call it at the moment, the North Greenwich Arena, 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/udoSE51f3ifiwSETA">ExCel London</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/sMAe321MVSFjXSHz6">the Thames 
Barrier,</a> and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HF71QjyoVA1LsDoC7">Olympic Stadium</a> in the distance. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MoAiLESSRJJwextVA">
journey </a>took 10 minutes, during which I managed to get a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Nbg3a4MWN3jrhquTA">photo taken of me</a>. <br><br>

A quick walk to the North Greenwich tube station, and a 10 minute ride on the Jubilee Line, saw me arrive at Waterloo, to go for a trip on the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/sbsA9tne1kZY8YHB8">London Eye</a>. There was quite a long queue for tickets, but I decided this was my only 
chance to go up and see the view during the Olympics, which included a view of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DmN81PuNu2ey9XPb6">beach 
volleyball court</a> across the river in Horseguards, so I happily <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/11t41Mp1v2xGQaRt5">queued</a> in the 
sunshine. It was well worth the wait. The wheel is 135 metres high and the one revolution trip takes 30 minutes. There were great views of 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nxdDxw7rhUPRNkX6A">The Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey,</a>with Battersea Pwer Station in the distance, 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ADe3i9vZ4xF5rgmM9">Charing Cross station</a> and the Hungerford Railway Bridge and the Golden Jubilee 
Pedestrian Bridges, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/i5hvae83CbeZyDaJ8">the City including the Gherkin and the Eye</a>, The Foreign, 
Commonwealth and Development Office plus The Treasury with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yXpL5DH9ECACca6t6">St. James' Park 
and Buckingham Palace in the background</a>. Also <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LVgS4AduqF51tgXx5">County Hall</a>, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/mVzk4eeb1dFZAbHi8">
Jubilee Park & Gardens</a>.<br><br>

Once my <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/S8QMzkMCh54HCk9z8">trip was over</a>, I took a walk along the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nWknneF4teMSTqx1A">
South Bank</a>. There were loads of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/M5VKgDHEmiYDngQ79">human statues</a>, in the area around the Jubilee 
Gardens, plus an <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/a5xkt4EepMKm7BBH7">old fashioned</a> <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XGVio9SzAjxRq7LS8">
merry go-round.</a> I then meandered over the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YQyJ5Kve45xgKtA19">Golden Jubilee Bridge</a> to catch the Tube
back to Epping and my Hotel.
