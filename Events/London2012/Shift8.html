<h1><font size="5" face="Verdana">Shift Eight C074 Lilac 10.00pm to 8.00am.</font></h1>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">Tuesday 31st July 2012</h1></font></i>

<font size="3" face="Verdana">Down to breakfast by 9.15am. Loaded up with loads of breakfast plus made bacon and scrambled egg toasted sandwich for lunch. Back to room to watch the Olympics on 

the telly. Wather was a bit dodgy but decided to do a bit of sightseeing en route to my night shift especially as I saw Tower Bridge would be lifting at 7.30pm.. 

Parked at Epping station by 6pm (which was still quite full) to change at Tottenham Court Road to get off at Charing cross. Took Trafalgar Square exit and headed 

there to see the silly hats on the statues there. Nelson's hat was made out of a Union Jack with an Olympic Torch attached. King George V1 had a crown fashioned on 

Brighton Pavilion. Sir Henry Havelock has a reflective fascinator. General Napier had a very wavy hat. Walked down Whitehall to Westminster Tube to make for Tower 

Bridge.

A family was a little upset that the Olympic rings were not hanging from Tower Bridge. I cheered them up by expalining they were up because it was going to lift at 

7.30pm. Bang on time the bridge lifted, a tall masted boat passed underneath, the bridge lowered and the rings came back down. Back on the tube trying to ignore 

the yodelling coming from the Austria House which was in place next to the tube station.

Checked in at 9.15pm eventually once the fleet woman had had a cup of tea. Only three of us were assigned to the Lilac team. After having a jacket potato with 

creamy mushroom sauce (very tasty), the usual wait ensued. Eventually just before midnight I was tasked to take two of the catering staff home. First stop was 

Chinford and then it was on to Enfield. Set DORS to take me back to Eton Manor which meant we went out of our way to get back onto the ORN. Hadn't realised we were 

so close to Lea Valley White Water Centre. Trip back was via M25 and M11. As came off M11 to A406 to turn onto A12, the guy in front braked. I thought he was lost 

so I overtook him and then pulled in front only to be flashed at by a bloody speed camera. Afer telling myself to slow down umpteen times over the last few days a 

lack of concentration and I must have been doing 70mph in a 50mph zone. Bugger.

Got back to Eton Manor at 1.30am where there were about 20 cars waiting. The fleet transport team staff left at about 2am. At 3.30 am control called to see how 

many of us were left at Eton Manor. The three of us were called back to the FDO. Shop Motability people sent me over to see a dispatcher at FDO. He said there was 

no work at the moment. There was however a driver wandering around looking for a lift. Eventually someone was tasked to take him. Apparently they were so busy 

ferrying staff and doing real RFT's at FDO they had to send a transport team member out as a driver. I asked why they hadn't asked the people at Eton Manor to do 

it but they said apologetically that they had been asked to man Eton Manor until 3.00am in case people were coming out of hospitality. Pity the people that asked 

for us didn't leave their own staff there.

7 of the night shift were by now in FDO. Listened to C311 getting totally lost on the way to the athletes village. Driver already there with RFT asked for another 

car to go to Wembley Park Plaza. Control said he didn't think he had any cars available. We radiod that there were 7 of us in the break area and Control said he 

had just come on shift and didn't know where anyone was.!!

Eventually asked to move up to P6 and get ready to check out but wait in FDO for the first 30 of the day staff to arrive. 20 had RFT's waiting for them and the 

next 30 were going to Heathrow. ^.25am came and we were allowed to go. Tube back to Epping, drive to hotel and in bed going to sleep by 8.30am
