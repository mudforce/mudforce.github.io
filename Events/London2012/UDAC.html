<font size="3" face="Verdana">Trip to collect uniform/accreditation started with Virgin Trains Wilmslow to Euston (First Class Traveller), Victoria Line to Oxford Circus, Central Line to Stratford, then DLR to Star Lane (Oyster Card checked). From there it was a 1 minute walk to UDAC, which is a large warehouse in the East End. Arrived at 9:50am and joined the back of the queue. Chatted to a guy based at the Hilton Hotel, Park Lane who will be checking accreditation and a women who will be front of house at ExCel.<br><br>

Doors opened at 10am and we snaked around the queue lanes waiting for registration. Got chatting to a T3 FDO based guy who had yet to have his role training. Gave him an overview of what was what. Once at initial registration I handed over my passport and unique reference number, confirmed my DOB, was handed a piece of paper containing my name and number and told to follow the yellow line on the floor. This took us around the corner to have a digital photo taken. I didn't have to remove my glasses but there was great emphasis on ensuring no Cotton Traders (not paid sponsors) logos were showing. We then followed the orange line to where the paper accreditation was printed out, put in a plastic folder for lamination and heated into the proper accreditation with the proper neck ribbon attached.<br><br>

The next queue checked that your accreditation worked by scanning the barcode on the accreditation, a uniform form was assigned and you took your number as per the deli queue to check the trainer size you needed. The trainers Next was an individual cubicle in the female area to work out the polo shirt, jacket and trousers required. XXL top and jacket were picked first time but the trouserws were more of an issue. Ended up with XXXL male trousers. Once form filled out, went to collection area. An Adidas bag with all the generic stuff (umbrella, water bottle, bag, swatch watch etc) was collected first then handed form over to get correct size polo shirts (2) and jacket, then 2 pairs of trousers, and then 2 pairs of grey socks and trainers.

Next queue was to check out the uniform. Each item scanned through the computer and repacked before you signed for what you had got, Final stop was the portacabin to get your Olympic Volunteer Oyster card. Bought a Team GB baseball cap you can only buy at an Olympic venue before leaving UDAC at 11.20. Reverse trip back to Euston included forgetting to  to slap my Oyster card at Star Lane and having to plead with the card inspector that it was my first time on the DLR. He let me off. Pint of Redemption Trinity in the Euston Tap beer garden  whislt people watching, a Virgin voyager train home via Crewe and the job was a good un. <br><br><br>
