<font size="3" face="Verdana">Virgin to Euston (First Class Traveller), Victoria Line to Oxford Circus, Central Line to Stratford, DLR to Star Lane (Oyster Card checked), 1 minute walk to UDAC, which is a large warehouse. Arrived 9:50am and joined the back of the queue. Chatted to a guy based at the Hilton Hotel, Park Lane checking accreditation and a women who is front of house at ExCel. Doors opened 10am and snaked around the queue lanes waiting for registration. Chatted to a T3 FDO guy who has yet to have his role training. Handed over passport and unique reference number, confirmed DOB, handed a piece of paper with name and number and told to follow yellow line on the floor.

This took us around the corner to have a digital photo taken. Didn't have to remove glasses but great emphasis on ensuring no Cotton Traders logo showing. Then followed orange line to where the paper accreditation was printed out, put in the plastic folder for lamination and heated into the proper accreditation with the proper neck ribbon attached.

The next queue checked that your accreditation worked, a uniform form was assigned and you took your number as per the deli queue to check the trainer size you needed. Next was an individual cubicle in the female area to work out the polo shirt, jacket and trousers required. XXL top and jacket were picked first time but the trouserws were more of an issue. Ended up with XXXL male trousers. Once form filled out, went to collection area. An Adidas bag with all the generic stuff (umbrella, water bottle, bag, swatch watch etc) was collected first then handed form over to get correct size polo shirts (2) and jacket, then 2 pairs of trousers, and then 2 pairs of grey socks and trainers.

Next queue was to check out the uniform. Each item scanned through the computer and repacked before you signed for what you had got, Final stop was the portacabin to get your Olympic Volunteer Oyster card. Bought a Team GB baseball cap you can only buy at an Olympic venue before leaving UDAC at 11.20. Reverse trip back to Euston included forgetting to  to slap my Oyster card at Star Lane and having to plead with the card inspector that it was my first time on the DLR. He let me off. Pint of Redemption Trinity in the Euston Tap beer garden  whislt people watching, a Virgin voyager train home via Crewe and the job was a good un.
