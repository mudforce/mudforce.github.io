<font size="3" face="Verdana">Dear Catherine,<br><br>

Thanks for accepting your Games Maker role with the Transport team! We're really looking forward to working with you to put on a fantastic 
Games this summer.<br><br>

Now that you have completed your AA Drivetech licence check, it’s time for you to take part in the online driving assessment. London 2012 takes 
the safety of its drivers and passengers seriously, so we’re asking all volunteers in driving roles to undertake this test. You will need to 
complete this assessment in order to make it to the next stage of the Games Maker journey. Don’t worry, it hasn’t been designed to catch you 
out, and will only take 30-40 minutes to complete.<br><br>

To start the online driving assessment, please follow the steps below.<br>

Step 1: Click on the link below to start your online assessment: http://london2012.docdiagnostics.co.uk<br>
Username: Your email address<br>
Password: London2012 (please note this password is case sensitive)<br>

Step 2: Follow the instructions on screen.<br><br>

You don’t need to finish the assessment in one sitting – you can save your answers and come back to it later. However, we do ask that you 
complete it within the next three weeks. If you’re having problems logging in, or experience any other technical issues, please email 
support@a2om.com. For queries about the assessment, please refer to the user guide on the welcome page of the online driving assessment.<br><br>

On completing this assessment, you’ll be invited to a practical in-car evaluation in April 2012. Don’t forget, you also need to attend 
Orientation, Role-specific and Venue-specific training. Check out the Games Maker timeline for more information.<br><br>

Many thanks,<br><br>

The London 2012 Transport team
