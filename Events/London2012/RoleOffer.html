You may have already attended a Games Maker selection event, but in case you haven't, we wanted to let you know that you're being considered for a driving role with one of our teams. (You'll be contacted separately about your selection event.) The safety of drivers and passengers is paramount to the London 2012 Organising Committee, so we will need to carry out a driving licence check on your behalf. If you’re offered a Games Maker role, you will also need to complete an online driving assessment and driver safety training.<br><br>

AA Drive Tech is conducting driving licence checks on our behalf, and will contact you soon, asking you to complete a data protection mandate. Once you’ve done this, they will then be able to check your driving licence details with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). In order for AA DriveTech to get in touch with you, we are providing them with your first and last name, as well as your email address and phone number. This information will be kept confidential by AA Drivetech and will only be used for the driving licence check as part of the Games Maker recruitment process.<br><br>

We would like to thank you for helping us to carry out these checks. Please note, AA Drivetech checks do not apply to foreign driving licence holders. If you hold a foreign licence, please click on the link below. If you have any queries, please call the Games Maker support centre on 0845 402 2012 or email info@gamesmaker.london2012.com  Opening hours are 8am to 8pm Monday to Friday and 10am to 6pm Saturday.<br><br>

Many thanks,<br><br>

The London 2012 Volunteer team<br><br>
