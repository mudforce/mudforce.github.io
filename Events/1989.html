Erica asked me to be her witness at the marriage service. I said yes provided I didn't have to wear anything bridesmaidy.Alistair had asked 
his little brother. It seems you don't need to be Catholic to witness a Catholic wedding. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/VmWEC3wAmJUcZaK58">
hen lunch</a> was a very respectable affair with both mother's present. The wedding day started with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/wJwMi5JkYmTRMaScA">
the bride</a> helping pump up her brother's wheelchair tyres. Typical Erica. I made sure I captured <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YjKDWnGWBEQuQ3zBA">
every moment</a> including some that the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/zvywdQLGVz8Ekc2F6">bride maybe didn't relish</a>.<br><br>

Erica arrived the church in a lovely <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KQu95UDgsxWVmcsP6">vintage car</a>. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/q4ZCYt2erooVxYBh7">
wedding was lovely</a>. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LBaUMVndERNL4ZZq5">photos</a> were taken in the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/oMVb9tBMAce1nyma9">
church grounds</a>. I have to say my outfit, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/peJL8GnXwQe6bE9v6">including hat</a>, was a success. We 
were a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7G3EvX93kYe3RLEu5">small group</a>, but <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KJnDJMG6uc1FLe7FA">
confetti chucking</a> ensued no problem. The reception was held in a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/cG5MQ2etxDiga2Dn8">local restaurant.</a>
It was a joyous affair with everyone on the top table which was a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K66VQwo8rfCLoopVA">large U shape</a>.<br><br>

I was working at the Cabot Carbon carbon black plant in Port-J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me-sur-Seine, and arranged to stay on after the week had ended. 
I was staying in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bauRXznZk5q85Hje6">L'Auberge du Cochon d'Or</a>, in Beuzeville, and Mum, Dad, Joan and 
Jean came over to spend the weekend with me. On the Saturday, we visited Honfleur, which sells itself as "The Jewel of the Normandy Coast". 
The name apparently comes from the Old Norse. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/o13PwZpeXXDEJsEA6">The old harbour</a> (Le vieux port) is 
known as a "floating harbour" with a constant water-level. It is supposedly one of the most picturesque in France, with its unique quayside 
of slate-fronted houses. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qPiQjFLYNG8ERzMEA">The Church of Sainte-Catherine</a> was built by shipwrights 
and is the largest wooden church with a separate bell-tower in France. The bell tower built a good distance away, so that parishioners 
wouldn't be burnt in case of a fire after a lightening strike.<br><br>

The following day we went to Fecamp, had a wander along the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3WW4CR7rrkM9u5j1A">promenade</a>, and stopped 
to have a coffee. Well <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/gbUArenYVZztThdUA">Jean,</a> Joan and Mum had a coffee. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MPnoC81PL5yEStXA7">
Dad and I</a> had a small glass of white wine. We also got to <a href="hhttps://photos.app.goo.gl/y4K2z6LoNYBSMQZq9">Caudebec-en-Caux </a>, 
which is on a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/wU5MWVF2vNyNvq9J9">bend in the River Seine</a> not far from Rouen.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">Early Summer 1989</h1></font></i>

I went to Tenerife for a week to stay with Liz, who was pregnant. She had a flat with Ignes in Candelaria, in the north of Tenerife, just 
south of the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Nes worked as a taxi driver in the capital. Liz was working in the management office of a time share 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Vf5JqZzaBryDUA7u7">resort<a/> in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PLyYDNBhSxnE6e3X8">Playa de Las 
Americas</a>. I went south with Liz when she went to work, and sat by the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YZLzD9V3TvG5z8nn7">pool</a> 
in the sun, meeting up with her for elevenses and lunch. We did spend a day <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D6ko1SxH8G7M3Jfb9">
travelling</a> round the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8Nvt7ic75sVRCpn6A">north of the island</a> away fom the <a href"https://photos.app.goo.gl/4QGp2ZZ6eA3rfJhF6">
coast</a> with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1K41SUyV8QV8o4778">Nes and his family</a><br><br>

<a href="89DaFrejus2.jpg"><img src="89DaFrejus2.jpg" width="550" height="353" title="Dad Frejus" border="0" align="right"></a>
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qZEDQLSRmg7QcvJm6">Philip and Eiry</a> got <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/BZDdWk38gkfYUyEU7">married
</a> in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qcCqufRpixzHT9M99">Saint Lukes Church</a>, Cwmdare. I have to say I was looking pretty 
smart in my <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/iRidSNNpcehygLDh6">grey suit</a> and the navy hat I bought for Erica's wedding. The 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bqPDJG7JMavWFUBKA">usual family</a> members were there on our side.<br><br>

Later in the month, I was working in the plant in Berre L'Etang, staying in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/QMo8jjnpLHWE68g3A">Marseile 
</a> at the Hotel Sofitel Marseille <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Cj77ZXWTmUpNFVSPA2">Vieux Port</a>, which indeed looked over the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/srpsKeNkmRmuLDT98">Vieux Port</a>, and enjoying a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HXCJvuDUkdGzTfhJ6">
few drinks</a> at night with Robert and the gang from the Berre plant. At the same time, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tpBMNa1uH3AqrFBL7">
Mum and Dad</a> were on holiday in a big <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AzsD4tVKntNq27p56">static caravan</a> on a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MaFbhqEUDiUDWGSZ8">
Sunsites campsite</a> just outside <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8sdasiCq4jLYr45VA">Frejus,</a> so I <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZfXCfAwGTW6CYo2p9">
stayed</a> for the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yD94ynFMtXad5iyPA">weekend with them</a>. I had to park my hire car outside the site, 
so as not to incur extra charges for Mum and Dad. We did go to the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9EdNP2U8SKAZtxeD8">beach,</a> but 
parking was a pain, and getting across the main road to the beach was just dangerous.<br><br>

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CE1C2PgVyJ153w6x5">I went down</a> to London to spend a weekend with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/d8zAPFCMHU7syt1K82">
Anne</a> and she and I spent the day in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Wi45pQWT7eyvviM38">Cambridge</a>. We thought of going 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LyKwzzEGpAdAuXP28">punting</a> but it was too bloody expensive.<br><br>
<a href="Thiepval.jpg"><img src="Thiepval.jpg" width="500" height="453" title="Theipval" border="0" align="left"></a>
Later on, I joined Mum, Dad and Jean on a trip to France. We stayed in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/VdvTAq8adFSNnpb76">
Montreuil-sur-Mer</a>, which isn't actually at the seaside. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Xd6SRhpi7B76hRhx5">old ramparts</a> of 
Montreuil look out over the valley of the river Canche, towards the sea at Etaples. Back in the 13th century this town was one of the 
wealthiest ports in northern Europe. The estuary of the River Canche then reached up to Montreuil; its quays thronged with sailing ships 
carrying pilgrims to the holy relics in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7hBPH6HNEvkCyn7B6">Montreuil's churches</a>. Above the port, on 
the 40m high chalk hill, stood the walled town and market place - all guarded by a royal castle built by French king Philippe Auguste. By 
the 16th century, the river had silted up. We stayed in the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/zXdAVmKj73pJnwYh7">Hotel de France</a>, 
where the owner was a flamboyant French lady of a certain age, to whom everything was "Formidable". The hotel was very old and none of the 
floors and walls were <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rGuiwF5Ref64mS1v5">straight</a> or <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1Y7zyqaotXawcLPQ6W">
flat.</a><br><br>

We took the opportunity to visit some of the WW1 sites that were in this Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. We visited <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/pL59EJRJkk2E98PG8">
Vimy Ridge</a>. The Battle of Vimy Ridge was a 1917 military offensive by the Canadian Corps against elements of the German Sixth Army. 
The Canadian Corps attack was part of the opening phase of the Battle of Arras. The Corps' objective was to take control of the 
German-held high ground at the northernmost end of the advance. We could see some reserved <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/G2sc78icAAMwHApM9">
WW1 trenches</a>, and the very striking <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/G2sc78icAAMwHApM9">memorial</a>.  The Canadian National Vimy 
Memorial is a Canadian National Historic Site and, one of Canada's most important overseas <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9YxUyazQHYJkS3217">
war memorials</a>. It is one of eight Canadian First World War memorials in Europe, constructed in tribute of the 66,000 Canadian war dead, 
including 11,285 with no known grave in France. It took 11 years to construct.<br><br>

We then headed south, through <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yFiqxEmYoRSqhjJn7">Arras</a>. The belfry of the gothic Town Hall is 
listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. During WW1, Arras was near the front and a long series of battles fought nearby are known as 
the Battle of Arras in which a series of medieval tunnels beneath the city, unknown to the Germans, became a decisive factor in the 
British forces holding the city.<br><br>

Driving further South, we reached Thiepval, and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qRipSvtmcnWrUjy17">Memorial to the Missing of the 
Somme</a>, a memorial to 72,090 British and South African men who died in the Battle of the Somme and who have no known grave. Designed by 
Sir Edwin Lutyens, the memorial was built between 1928 and 1932 and is the biggest British battle memorial in the world. <br><br>

My final trip of 1989 was to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xiAHS6XdA47TY2PR7">Glaisdale</a>, to visit the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ro3SP5UvJBEwfnBWA">
Matlby's</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nuj4vMMSqwmhECzg6">Ruth</a> had been to visit with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xzb79Y2dR5xCYtYK9">
Nick</a>, earlier in the year when she was visiting her Gran, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/wMvAC8adyY4DHKNPA">I </a>was making a 
reciprocal visit to deliver my temporary plastic washing machine which I no longer needed but Ruth needed to cope with both Nick and 
Kirsten. We had a great weekend traipsing around the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/WtFRsLoA4LF959DU7">countryside</a> in the North 
York Moors around Glaisdale.
