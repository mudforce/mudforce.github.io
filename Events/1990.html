This being 1990, Dad was celebrating being 65 and Mum was 60, so they had a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1TM2xkPZc18nRF1aA">joint 
birthday</a> celebration, inviting a few <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/BDmpvFx526mWMKgt5">friends</a> to the house for a 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vKzcBDC2EE2483sT9">few nibbles</a> and a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dbqkshhZCADYrNx88">special 
joint birthday cake</a>.<br><br>
<a href="GangPool.jpg"><img src="GangPool.jpg" width="550" height="353" title="Carvoeiro Pool" border="0" align="left"></a>
Later in the year I joined Mum, Dad, Jean and Joan on holiday in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nRVpmjYKkKhLx7N18">Dick's villa</a> 
just up the hill from Carvoeiro in the Algarve, Portugal. The villa is lovely, with a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jNgMqExXDqgSsSaX8">
large living room</a>, and smaller dining room, off which there is the kitchen. Mum and Dad took the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5cXKsLwe3b3hwP1n9">
master bedroom</a>.

There is a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/W96AXm9b4bp8Zxay6">good size pool</a>, with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/msDtANNZAnuCRvkv5">
steps</a> to walk in at the shallow end. The villa has its own <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bKrYiKoKZDhhY4pV6">mini barbie</a> by the 
pool, and I just had to have a go at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/59PpmbCNipdMSQEF6">cooking on it</a> for our dinner, complete with 
a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/QEu5ZLrE3a7XkwJNA">glass of local vino</a> of course. The pool was great for 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hmef843BCtxdu6G48">soaking your feet</a> after a hard day relaxing. You could get up onto the roof of 
the villa from which you could see some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MXRJyswthJ4dsxsR7">lovely sunsets</a> and have a view over the 
whole developmwnt <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9NQd66oMB3DA6j6s6">towards the sea</a>.<br><br>

The beach in town, Praia de Carvoeiro, is quite small and had <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SWbmsgAUY95ahLcr9">fishing boats</a> 
moored on it, and has a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/eHLYnzGpcAvaEeeX6">mini town square</a> leading up to it. Up the hill above the 
beach is the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/guEF6B8tMyG9nYm89">Forte de Nossa Senhora de Encarna&ccedil;&atilde;o</a> which used to be 
a fort guarding the coastline, but was mostly destroyed in an earthquake, leaving just the chapel in use. A quick walk along the clifftop 
and you reach the very local tourist spot of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PBZZ83boNuH3LT2C8">Algar Seco</a>. The Algar Seco are a 
series of cliff formations carved out of the limestone bedrock. There used to be an archway at the top but that has eroded with time. At 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qx82gSdCJedKCNAt7">the bottom</a> of a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tjATWxV5NHnKTCcq6">flight of 
steps</a>, there is a cave known as A Boneca.<br><br>
<a href="Sandcastle2.jpg"><img src="Sandcastle2.jpg" width="550" height="353" title="Sandcastles" border="0" align="right"></a>
Our normal routine every other day was to walk down to the new <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qse7hYcy7k2Hp4rc9">Municipal Market</a>, 
where we could buy fish, meat, cheese and vegetables. Then we walked down into town to buy an English paper near to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Z89aS95vqBJDXG3CA">
the bank </a>. We also stopped for a cup of coffee/glass of white wine at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AXvDp1eRtw1tyB9TA">coffee 
shop</a> run by a British lady who has lived in the town for many years. On those days we didn't need to shop, we had 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/R8CUHgiuZdNeRNgYA">elevenses</a> next to the pool. For the wrinklies, there was always 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1aN2mB1mmoqya9re6">a siesta</a> after lunch, sometimes <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kjLjMLnYbnuzvSxP9">
inside on the sofa</a>. On one of the cloudier days, we took the short drive to the nearby town of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/pYkbQKZzVsFzmw686">
Portimao</a> and resort of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HTopP6KMW9TjaEfS9">Praia da Rocha</a>. Another day we drove up into the hills 
to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7XiQQMQgxGc979E48">Monchique</a> where we had <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Jop6Pf7rYcAfxTbN9">
lunch</a>. Another destinaion was <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DXdL9J2kTW4PF6Sq6">Arma&ccedil;ao da Pera</a><br><br>

Mum and Dad came up to spend a weekend with me, and we had a day out to Matlock. We went up in the cable car to the top of the Heights of 
Abraham. There is a Tower at the top, the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aCdZhM7TBQJM91Lz8">Victoria Prospect Tower</a>. It was built 
in 1844 for the early Victorian tourists and restored in 1978. You can <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RVL3tT24ugsQAxDc9">climb the 
Tower</a> to enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding Derbyshire countryside. We gave the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KCoogHSH559XTDxx8">
Great Masson Cavern</a> a miss as Mum is a little claustraphobic at times.<br><br>
<a href="PantoCast.jpg"><img src="PantoCast.jpg" width="550" height="353" title="Panto Cast" border="0" align="left"></a>
A little <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SQVJXQpqg1dRYkCw5">later on</a> in the year, Phil, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vyyvXLHyYZQtJhZ99">
Anne</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZJVZ8XrUveH5bWnB9">Elaine and I</a> went on a day trip to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dTdJyEjUygX2Gati7">
Boulogne</a> and Le Touquet, including a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/afSSkJtR5ECiK5h47">booze trip</a> to the supermarket. We had a 
good look around the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/N3QzfgXARZ4JYev3A">market</a> in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/T2bxxv9NKsThjFyA8">
Boulogne</a>. We had great fun building <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/s6pP8UQ6evaNUQjg7">sand castles</a> on <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hQQQUDYXnQFzPL1L7">
the beach</a>. We decided against the trip of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ybkzyV3dAwSJFRVu7">Petit Train</a> as we wandered 
along the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/gGkd123kSbcWX1HT6">prom</a>. After lunch, we discovered a fabulous patisserie shop, with the 
most gorgeous cakes and fancy chocolates in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/BrVfU6hwP6p3FhmA8">Le Touquet</a> Town.<br><br>

At the end of the year was the Barracks Fabrics Staff's Children's Christmas Party. An annual event, this year I was asked to write a 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Rq9M2yimqreHuWmZ9">panto</a> for us to stage. There was a restriction on the storyline. I had to use the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yt5L4YvcikGjrTrT6">fancy dress costumes</a> we had available. So the story was:-<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/g31NzgQVmrwRFZTV7">
Santa Claus</a> had had his presents stolen by an evil <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qV8b9hNyh2hSHejQA">Bumble Bee</a>. Mickey and 
Minnie Mouse arrived to help Santa and his workers, Minnie HaHa, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SaZrFKhfa8rxdpp37">a nun</a>, and a 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/b6BXuZXqqkfR1zP56">Clown</a>, to recapture the pressies. I was the narrator and dressed as an 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/EiKnib5tLRg8yHpq8">Arab Sheik</a>. I didn't have time to write actual lines, only the story, so it 
was totally ad-libbed, and needed the narrator to keep things moving in the right direction. After the story finished, the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7Ps8B7BFUNxTwvaM9">kids came up on stage</a> to throw custard pies at a couple of the staff, play some 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kjGtYcQH6UWBQEfC9">party games</a>, and collect their presents, before having a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FQycK973cyXAJ9XM7">
special tea</a>.
