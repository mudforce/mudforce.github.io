The Grand Depart in 2014 was such a success, the organisers decided to go ahead with a Tour de Yorkshire in 2015, and I just had to 
volunteer for that. First of all we had to go through a training session at the West Yorkshire Police headquarters, just off the M1 near 
Wakefield. We had to show photo id to get into the building, and were warned that helicopters might be landing, and blue flashing 
lights dashing past. The vast majority of the attendees had been volunteers in 2014. The police guys were very funny and made the 
training, which was the usual stuff about how to deal with crowds, entertaining.<br><br>
<a href="TDY.JPG"><img src="TDY.JPG" width="550" height="353" title="TourdeYorkshire" border="0" align="left"></a>
I was assigned to Day Two of the race, which had both men and women racing. The women were just doing the finishing circuit around York 
five times. The men's stage started in Selby and ended in York, doing the finishing circuit twice. Unlike the Tour proper, they were 
not closing the roads for the whole day, except on the finishing circuit. All the volunteers assigned to the York finishing circuit had 
to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vqpEKAWSucaGrAHW6">report in</a> at York racecourse. We had no uniform per se, but we had been 
given left over Tour de France stuff, so a lot of us were wearing Tour de France hoodies. After spending ages sitting around, we were 
put on buses to be taken out to our assigned spots. Our lot, who were going to Osbaldwick, were last off the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dAvTbsdoUyvJPsQn6">bus</a>.<br><br>

I was allocated a corner on the way into the village, which was at a T junction with the link road onto a main road into York. I had to 
deal with everyone driving up the link road, telling them that they couldn't even cross the road for the rest of the day. One of the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3yKku1ZhZipopdJg8">Flag and Whistle</a> marshalls was already in place, as the kink in the road was 
quite dangerous at speed. <a href=">https://photos.app.goo.gl/YUsajqkVS2tQEqKAA">The Women's race</a> came through <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ohTRHpt4uyZVxsTo8">
first</a>. Then we had a bit of a break before the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XXDvwNF3MuZAjRGh8">men came through</a>.<br><br>

A week later, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/G9q65D7u5mxzuWbSA">Mum </a>and I were off to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/WTej5QYAzqm8f7BQA">
Tenerife </a>for a week's holiday. As usual we were staying up at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4pxqCLpn1F9CpkPP7">Hotel Botanico</a>
 & Oriental Spa in Puerto de la Cruz. This time our room was on the inside of the hotel <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7HkJ3YaFGF8PSqvH7">overlooking 
the swimming pool</a>. A lovely week doing nothing but eating and drinking, with someone else cooking.<br><br>

Once home, I took a Sunday trip over to the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/BktsbxdbXiDd8oo98">West Kirby Marine Lake</a> and 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/y7kWFPpiFrFzy3hR8">Beach</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Y4p5Uvw4LjoaqUYCA">The Marine Lake 
is a man-made saltwater <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZKjCZ7z3JzHgZaV47">lake,</a> 52 acres in size, 5 foot deep and totally 
enclosed. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vnb9X3xc842FsDGa6">The beach was miles</a> from the actual sea.<br><br>

I decided to do a bit of a history trip so I could do a People & Places track for the Talking Newspaper. First stop <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RUNnZQfDTNQnr28g9">
Flint Castle</a>. This was the first castle to be founded as part of Edward I's campaign against Llywelyn ap Gruffydd. It is also the 
location of a fateful meeting in 1399 between Richard II and his rival to the crown Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV), an event 
immortalised in Shakespeare's Richard II. Next was <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/26fXYSmMtC4k8JFA8">Rhuddlan Castle</a>. Built to 
use a river to receive supplies, the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CDYx3WPt5dd9vqxm8">River Clwyd</a> didn't meander in quite the 
right place, so Edwatd I conscripted hundreds of ditch-diggers to deepen and divert its course.<br><br>
<a href="12thNight5.jpg"><img src="12thNight5.jpg" width="550" height="353" title="Oddsocks" border="0" align="right"></a>
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/V8Qfc4sXzUDCVA1f6">Denbigh Castle</a> was once the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/45kb15BemkSNUXTt5">royal residence</a> 
of Dafydd ap Gruffudd, whose attack on nearby Hawarden Castle provoked the English king Edward I to mount a full-scale invasion. It has 
a fabulous <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nFk9xF5SFj8jddPb6">gatehouse</a>. Back across the border to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/n9izsLGLgdForq1eA">
Beeston Castle</a>, one of the most <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/VZywgaH6VYSDsJbo8">dramatically sited</a> medieval castles in 
England. <br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">July 2015</h1></font></i>

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qzVevwykv3tPk1nWA">Outdoor Theatre</a> time, at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Qsg4mkMYMsdBLWAr6">
summer theatre</a> created at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/cXrnC5v9dJCf5aUNA">Gawsworth Hall</a>, with the <a href=">https://photos.app.goo.gl/6rQpo1LQiz7vobBR9">
Oddsocks Touring Company,</a>, who were doing Twelfth Night. The initial showers didn't put off the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/k9L4jhiD6mXyMVXd6">stalwart</a> 
British picnicers. I was nice and dry underneath a big tree, but eventually the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Z5DonhZH8Tg5xyj66">
sun came out</a>.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">August 2015</h1></font></i>

Another new event for me. The English National Sheepdog Trials, taking place just outside Macclesfield on the Leek Road. There were 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ym92pcqSs7nCkzux6">craft tents</a> with painters, knitters and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aH4ux12ypRC6Bjx87">spinners</a>, 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/GHf1K2jqnUp8kbn98">rare farm breeds</a>, a tent selling local produce including the Wincle brewery 
and the Cheshire Cheese Company (I bought both beer and cheese), and working sheepdogs, both <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/J87v3gDRAjX9fVo4A">
singles</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ba8rvpC6yuCLYiNg9">doubles</a>.

The Rugby World Cup had arrived in England. Wales were playing their matches in Cardiff and I got a ticket to see them play Uruguay. 
The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6s29yRQrVLLfYyEs52">atmosphere</a> on match day was as good as always, and lots of people were 
taking <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/BT9Yot57we7LsSGZ7">selfies</a> with the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tRAfQ2f6aGYDCfph8">
art installation</a> of the ball embedded in the castle wall. The Cardiff Arms Park pitch had been turned into a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/y4HkjKigvPLxP8Gp9">
fan zone</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/NbZUsjeLYw3vdVHZA">I enjoyed</a> the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6h1oi6nbrvDf9Zgh7">match,</a> 
but as I was on the end of a row, I spent a lot of time letting guys in and out to get drinks and let previous ones out.

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">October 2015</h1></font></i>

The Macclesfield Eye Society were manning a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DZ6KcZz5w3Ez37wB8">water station</a> for the Macclesfield 
Half Marathon, so I decided to volunteer to help. The station was located on Whirley Lane, at the 11 mile mark, at the top of quite a 
steep hill. The big house we were next to allowed us to use their external tap to refill our water containers, and made us cups of 
tea/coffee. It was a very pleasant exprience. Almost every runner that took a drink gave us very grateful thanks. <br><br>

The following weekend was the Manchester weekend for the Rugby World Cup. England's final match qualifying match had been scheduled to 
be played at the Ethiad Stadium, as a celebration to spread the rugby word up north. Unfortunately, they had lost to both Australia, 
and of course, Wales, so the match was a dead rubber. The official World Cup volunteers were only working on the Saturday that England 
were playing. They were lining the walking route to the stadium from the City Centre, or welcoming people to the stadium.<br><br>

I was part of a separate group that had been loaned to Manchester City Council to help them man a weekend long Fan zone in 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Dy7QEFuX9PyDXogZA">Albert Square</a>. There was a stage on which the MC introduced various 
celebrities and local groups, two big screens to watch the matches, stalls and bars to get food and drink, and a number of rugby 
related <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D7vzB8SiXaudngva9">activities</a> which <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/wWgWN2UtyPCAx9Wu5">
we volunteers</a> were manning. We were given exactly the same kit as the official volunteers, apart from the official accreditation. 
It must have cost a fortune, but had no sponsors logos, only the IRB official RWC logo. A polo shirt, a rugby shirt, a fleece, a pair 
of trousers and a really good waterproof coat, socks and shoes, and a vile bright yellow baseball cap.<br><br>

Our activities comprised a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XvLCwnujGvfYopaw6">Speed Pass</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/iqQjnDp8CAXkC1Bc9">
Precision Pass booth</a>, plus a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tB5iQXNadGqpukdd7">Bungee Run</a>. The first booth had a speed gun 
set up to measure how hard and fast a rugby ball was being passed. The second had a number of holes in the back, of differing sizes, 
and the idea was to pass a rugby ball three times through the holes, the smaller the hole, the more points scored. Our job was to 
collect the balls once used. Although they were only three quarter size, they were quite big for my litle hands, and my hands were 
aching after manning the booths. The Bungee Run had bungee ropes attached to belts, and participants had to run down the inflatable 
and dive to score the first try. Our job was to put on and take off the belts.<br><br>
<a href="Lego3.jpg"><img src="Lego3.jpg" width="350" height="453" title="Lego RWC" border="0" align="left"></a>
On the Friday, during the day there were no matches, and our visitors were mostly parties of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hob1vw1SVCVKpyfp7">
school children</a>, who obviously enjoyed the Bungee Run. I did not envy the accompanying teachers. There was one evening match. 
New Zealand played Tonga. Pre match, a New Zealand group did the Haka, whilst some Tongans did their equivalent, the Sipi Tau. A lot of 
guys came to watch the match after work, and after doing the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/s73vNWuNRy9dvBkA9">Bungee Run</a> had 
torn their very expensive shirts or suit trousers.<br><br>

On the Saturday, there were three matches, Samoa v Scotland, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/97w3vsJoBnZ2Mem97">Wales v Australia</a> 
and England v Uruguay. The "official volunteers" arrived before the England match, and one of the supervisors started telling 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aoQHZs525qo4tb97A">our lot</a>what to do. We politely told him, we had our own supervisor, 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D3ug1Rogx63aDULYA">Craig </a>from the Council, so "Go away". We were pleased to note that we had 
vouchers to get hot food from some of the stalls, and access to the Town Hall to eat on our break, whilst the official lot only had 
sandwiches, crisps and fruit. The actual <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RL7cxeKunD5ANdJ4A">Rugby World Cup</a> was also on site, 
so people could have their photos taken with it.<br><br>

Sunday saw matches between Argentina v Namibia, Italy v Romania and United States v Japan, for which the crowds were very small, plus
France v Ireland (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CQnc8Dm3vEzUuvNv7">NI Dave</a> was obviously excited by that), which was packed 
out, although the Irish were drinking in the local pubs where they could get Guinness rather than the fan zone, where they couldn't 
pre match. A lot of the Irish lasses going on the Bungee run seemed to not be wearing any knickers. I was given an additional task - 
guarding the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/N423mGpunXgjdKkn9">Lego replica World Cup</a>. It stayed in one piece all day, until 
the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/y47UXUAmd4VHpE6N6">lass tasked</a> with taking it back to Twickers picked it up and one of the 
handles came off. being Lego it was easy to stick it back on. At the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tWKyRzJ9zgEQ7VJH7">end of the 
day</a>, we were invited on stage to pose behind the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8GkMGHwoUiw4Tvvi7">RWC2015 sign</a>, and Craig 
told me about the MCRVIP website I could sign up to for future opportunities locally.<br><br>

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jaWhcfypasYhPY1w6">Mum </a>and I had a second trip to Tenerife and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vGfy7BWYoVccAKWG7">
Hotel Botanico & Oriental Spa</a>. Our room was again on the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PgRw1434x3qVg3Zx5">side of the Hotel</a>, overlooking the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/L86hemBSJBVcRwro7">Spa Gardens</a>, and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fdCwv9MqyvaehrP9A">
Spa.</a> Our <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FKS6UFHf1S5c6uDe8">favourite restaurant</a>, with the very chatty (in Spanish), was 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/mPSAY5rpMJAyVQrL7">frequented</a> on most nights. Mum is not got at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RnFF7qxsUrijvMHe6">
doing a selfie</a>. As ever, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/mtErSgyXTgwUo8VA9">we </a>didn't go anywhere (except the Mall to get 
wine from the Supermarket), and didn't do anything except <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SM1xCZiuPmVmsxkd6">eat and drink</a>.

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">December 2015</h1></font></i>

Mum was her usual <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fqgdd4mXKhVBJmaCA">supervisory self</a> when it came to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/sXfDPSYiYBbrvVKk6">
Christmas lunch</a>, which included our usual <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nVSYTnNUVrvuVqMh6">Meursault wine</a>. She at least 
knew where the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kUQ5CVqky9BLuUvz9">Christmas Crackers</a> had been put last year.
