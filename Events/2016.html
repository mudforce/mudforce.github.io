<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">January 2016</h1></font></i>

The year started with a trip to Buxton to see Sarah Millican at the Opera House in her Outsider Tour. As it was January, I didn't risk 
travelling over the Cat and Fiddle late at the night, as who knew what the weather would be like. I spent the night at the The 
Westminster Hotel which is located on Broad Walk overlooking the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SSTpVX44B4DX8wKa8">Pavilion Gardens</a>. 
Lovely cooked breakfast the next morning.<br><br>

<a href="BarryIsalnd.jpg"><img src="BarryIsalnd.jpg" width="550" height="353" title="Barry Island" border="0" align="left"></a>
I took a few snaps of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jEVymfLxwaHRUXt17">Barry Island</a> and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/L2tPEqWHx1oDDxgPA">
Prom</a> whilst home at the end of the month, as it was looking lovely in the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JvAS9yxxKxhfBAW66">
winter sunshine</a>. The same goes for this <a href"https://photos.app.goo.gl/RQoRaNJ3dcMbWHXN6">picture</a> in the October sunshine.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">February 2016</h1></font></i>

I did my first ever MCRVIP event, the National Squash Championships and the Masters Squash Championships. The big names were playing 
primarily on the two <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5N9CkfB2k4mtn6ecA">glass courts</a>. The Masters were playing on the bog 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kcoxpR5dAkaLYeiy9">standard glass backed courts</a>. I was initially paired up with 
Peter Maguire, and old hand, doing court maintenance. That is, moping the court at the end of each game, and cleaning the glass at the 
end of each match. Before I knew it, I was doing it on my own. Bit overawed to start with but it soon became clear it wasn't rocket 
science. I really enjoyed myself and all the MCRVIP old hands were very friendly.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">April 2016</h1></font></i>

Next was the Greater Manchester Marathon. The start/finish line was outside <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JXVbDEETLPvcDQZo6">
Old Trafford Cricket Club</a>. I was assigned the area by the Metro stop to direct people, runners and public towards the start/finish 
line. Badly organised, I had to go get my lunch as my supervisor failed to show up. As the first runners came across the finish line, 
it became clear there was a problem. Runners were leaving without their kit bags because the <a href=">https://photos.app.goo.gl/AC85AR4TMZYS2TdSA">
queue </a>to reclaim the baggage was huge. I went into the ground, and the sight reminded me of a disaster movie. There were people everywhere wrapped in tinfoil blankets, 
trying desperately to get their left luggage back. The organisers had saved money and moved from Old Trafford Football to Old Trafford 
Cricket, and there wasn't enough room in the left luggage area. Throwing people at the problem wouldn't solve it. There wasn't room for 
any more people to enter the area. I had to loan my phone to people who had left theirs in their bags, and at one 
point had to go and get a man's bag so he wouldn't miss his plane out of Liverpool.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">May 2016</h1></font></i>

I was back doing the Tour de Yorkshire, although a bit further afield this time. After a repeat of the training at the West Yorkshire 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/WVraw8fQD6TfSgUNA">Police training </a>facility near Wakefield, I was assigned to Grosmont in the 
North Yorkshire Moors National Park. I decided to travel over the night before and stay in Glaisdale at Red House Farm B&B, taking in 
some scenery enroute. Instead of going the normal route, straight north out of Pickering, I turned left and didn't turn north until 
Aislaby. That took me up over <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K6ZXhN1fqfqEYrCj6">Hartoft Rigg</a>, and into Glaisdale down a very 
steep and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/i51s9buM3cgvg8pDA">windy hill</a>. The B&B took a bit of finding, but was very comfy.<br><br>
<a href="DavisCupMe.jpg"><img src="DavisCupMe.jpg" width="350" height="453" title="Davis Cup" border="0" align="right"></a>
Had time for a fabulous cooked breakfast, and to tell my fellow guests the best way to see the race, before parking up on the outskirts 
of Grosmont. I made sure my allocated spot was at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RJViqdhQiygz8ygf8">level crossing</a> by 
the station for the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4sD34dfACM5t4kBP6">steam railway</a>. When the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/G6Y5v6mooMnBiYkw9">
publicity caravan</a> came through, it stopped and blocked the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6B9sZZVwihemJ4io9">railway line</a>. 
The station manager was not a happy bunny. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KEjhSJnqpwQt2ujG7">The race </a>wasn't far 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/G88kFE8KNu94sw5X8">behind</a>. I took the opportinity to go over to 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/16CmLzLCUiZhwpm68">Hinderwell</a> and meet up with the Maltby's. Kirsten and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/mnKVbe9y53Fk6iBRA">
Rosa were there</a>.<br><br>

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/oMUmHuVpQr1pCQvZA">Mum </a>and I had another week's holiday in Tenerife up in Puerto de la Cruz. It 
is often cloudy up north, and can be a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hZwAWVne91YGyonB6">little cool</a>. Our hotel room on the 
inside of the hotel had lovely views of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Kt6U1Kkr3vcwucWUA">Teide</a>. On our return, I had my first 
experience of being a Lancashire Cricket volunteer at a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tZgCX4YsSp8EHLGV9">T20 Blast match</a>. 
A lot of the Squash MCRVIP lot were also there as vets. First introduction to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/WKKyh7yjDpU5w3qD6">
Lanky</a>.<br><br>

A lot of the same people were also at the Tennis at the Northern Club in Didsbury. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/eW4u2FTtRT6bf2MGA">
The Davis Cup</a>, which is huge, was also there. Tradition says that only the people who win the cup can touch it. The people who 
assembled it on site did so wearing gloves. My first task was to be the scorer at a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/2U7Wm1zFFYAzmvVW9">
Parent and Child </a>tournament taking place on the clay courts. That was ore difficult than it sounds. Cathie Sabin, the LTA President 
introduced herself to me. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/NzcDYm3DLj8g4itG7">The Manchester Trophy Challenger</a> was a pre 
Wimbledon men's <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/GVqHqet2SnTW3bWQ9">grass court tournament</a>, that was won by 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3zsiPgnVDf2HJdrs6">Dustin Brown</a>.<br><br>

The World Rugby Under20 Championships were held in Manchester,using the Ethiad Academy pitch and the AJ Bell stadium. I was one of the 
volunteers at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yopS2vFkX95TMw3R6">AJ Bell</a>. I had applied for a rugby specific role,but was a 
tad dismayed to be assigned Pitchside Entertainment. Before I could tell them they could stick the cheer leading pom-poms where the 
sun don't shine, they assured us that we would be working with the professional team who were in charge of all off pitch stuff, 
including pre-match anthems and flags.<br><br>
<a href="ManchU20.jpg"><img src="ManchU20.jpg" width="550" height="353" title="TUnder 20 Rugby" border="0" align="left"></a>
It was one of the best roles I've had. We were an integral part of the team, wearing radio headsets, attending the pre match 
briefings and following the day long script. During the qualifying rounds, there were three matches a day. First task, get the guard 
of honour,(usually kids), for the anthems sorted. They had to be lined up in height order with flags. On cue, we had to march them 
onto the pitch and laid out in a fanned out V. Once both anthems had been played, we had to get them off the pitch as quickly as 
possible. Next up find volunteers for the half-time and between match games - Space Hopper and Hampster Ball races - and help getting 
those on and off the pitch. Once the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5LgdEgcNsS4TMjGG6">rugby</a> actually started, we could watch, 
usually from our volunteer room, which was one of the hospitality boxes in the mainstand, which had its own balcony. When the Ethiad 
people joined us for the finals, they were jealous as their room was in the bowels of the stadium where they could see nothing. 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7snWcnVx7rG7h83f8">Argentina</a> quickly became our favourites, both on and off the pitch, especially 
after they beat South Africa. They lost to Ireland in the semis, who went on to lose the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/gLRdZAvcph8KkPLR8">
final</a> to England. We volunteers got a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9Bi5u4RL7QgpvCWJ7">thank-you letter</a> from Bill Beaumont, 
Chairman of World Rugby.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">July 2016</h1></font></i>

Another trip to Gawsworth Hall to see the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rUzmXVY3btasMqAC7">Oddsocks Touring Company</a>, this 
time doing Much Ado about Nothing. Much better weather this time nut just as much fun watching people <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/cCALS3Ni1WUTHbybA">
picnicing</a> from my favourite spot under the tree.<br><br>

Later in JulyI was at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jVp6xs7YH2fZ8Rxw7">Old Trafford</a> for the 2nd Test between England and 
Pakistan. I was in duty all day for the four days of the Test. An interesting start had me on duty directing traffic down at the 
Tram stop, and watching a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FEatGgbjERQhHcxP8">Walking Pepperami</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MQviWHzscekbKJiv9">
England </a>batted first. Alistair Cook made 105 and Joe Root 254, as England made 589 for 8 declared. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9oW2q9poAMYeDjcU8">Pakistan</a> 
were bowled out for 198. England didn't enforce the follow-on and made a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Lt9vQhFW76Mem5Cf8">quick 173</a>
for 1, Cook and Root both ending up not out in the 70's. Pakistan facing a target of 565, were all out for 234. On Day 3, 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZCbg2qybNUz54xtS7">Blowers</a> was outside the Old Trafford shop, signing copies of his latest book,
and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/P5UxkZVo5G9e2XmG8">Champions Trophy</a> was on display.<br><br>

At the end of the month, I spent the weekend staying at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Zfsx5jdhgKKwpxHm8">The Chequers Inn</a> 
to attend the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hcVKsBCa7vQVpbc37">Women's British Open</a> in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/pMqCUWV4DyUx8dFc7">
Woburn</a>. It was not my favourite course, being an <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/wnRWnKTJaCYjKVUj8">inland, parkland,</a> 
tree-lined course, rather than a links course. Spotted both <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Y3AvNxDZUhqYAyzg7">Karen Stupples</a> 
and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/EVJX8uFQ61wPjZuD6">Ken Brown</a> working for the TV coverage.

More sports volunteering, this time via Cheshire East Council. The Tour of Britain cycle race was spending the day in Cheshire. I 
started the day as a supervisor of a team manning a crossing at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ndeeyzy98JyPgfnR6">start in Congleton</a>.
Once the race was en-route, we jumped in a minibus and were driven to the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tXxWx6dhaWaPAJwA7">Cat and 
Fiddle</a>, getting there before the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/u387hRvuDqXq7MHc8">race did</a>. There was already a bossy 
supervisor on site, so I reverted to being a pleb. <br.<br>

The atmosphere at the England v Pakistan T20 match at Old Trafford was amazing. The Pakistan fans had hired a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8ew88whwr2fvMXBY6">
double-decker bus</a>, and were driving around the ground for two hours before the match started. After their win, the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7izxSP4AwGSwZXJG6">singing
and dancing</a> was great, and, of course, not a drop of drink involved.<br><br>

The MCRVIP crowd were on duty at the Manchester Science and Industry Museum, which was the starting point for the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/pcLH4gcFKa2wwe2z7">
Heroes Parade</a>, celebrating the homecoming of the Rio Olympic and Paralympic Athletes. We, combined with the Museum own volunteers, 
were helping get the athletes onto the correct float in the correct order. The weather all morning was lovely, until the athletes had 
to board the floats when it started to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/g6XpygutAUSgWHCu6">rain </a>and we were in charge of handing 
out rain ponchos. My float had some swimmers and divers, plus, the ever smiling boxer, Nicola Adams. We spent all morning in the 
Museum with so many famous and familiar faces. Two lads, interlopers, blagged their way onto one of the floats, but not one manned by 
the MCRVIP lot.<br><br>

End of October, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FYHL4AQQBpzzJiiS8">Mum </a>and I were back in Puerto de la Cruz at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hureeHz5RqfyzFAK9">
Hotel Botanico</a> & Oriental Spa. We actually go to see snow on top of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/N9JBdabPph5idADFA">Teide</a>.
