<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">January 2016</h1></font></i>

The year started with a trip to Buxton to see Sarah Millican at the Opera House in her Outsider Tour. As it was January, I didn't risk 
travelling over the Cat and Fiddle late at the night, as who knew what the weather would be like. I spent the night at the The 
Westminster Hotel which is located on Broad Walk overlooking the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SSTpVX44B4DX8wKa8">Pavilion Gardens</a>. 
Lovely cooked breakfast the next morning.<br><br>

I took a few snaps of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jEVymfLxwaHRUXt17">Barry Island</a> and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/L2tPEqWHx1oDDxgPA">
Prom</a> whilst home at the end of the month, as it was ooking lovely in the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JvAS9yxxKxhfBAW66">
winter sunshine</a>.

I did my first ever MCRVIP event, the National Squash Championships and the Masters Squash Championships. The big names were playing 
primarily on the two <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5N9CkfB2k4mtn6ecA">glass courts</a>. The Masters were playing on the bog 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kcoxpR5dAkaLYeiy9">standard glass backed courts</a>. I was initially paired up with 
Peter Maguire, and old hand, doing court maintenance. That is, moping the court at the end of each game, and cleaning the glass at the 
end of each match. Before I knew it, I was doing it on my own. Bit overawed to start with but it soon became clear it wasn't rocket 
science. I really enjoyed myself and all the MCRVIP old hands were very friendly.<br><br>

Next was the Greater Manchester Marathon. The start/finish line was outside <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JXVbDEETLPvcDQZo6">
Old Trafford Cricket Club</a>. I was assigned the area by the Metro stop to direct people, runners and public towards the start/finish 
line. Badly organised, I had to go get my lunch as my supervisor failed to show up. As the first runners came across the finish line, 
it became clear there was a problem. Runners were leaving without their kit bags because the <a href=">https://photos.app.goo.gl/AC85AR4TMZYS2TdSA">
queue </a>to reclaim the baggage was huge. I went into the ground, and the sight reminded me of a disaster movie. There were people everywhere wrapped in tinfoil blankets, 
trying desperately to get their left luggage back. The organisers had saved money and moved from Old Trafford Football to Old Trafford 
Cricket, and there wasn't enough room in the left luggage area. Throwing people at the problem wouldn't solve it. There wasn't room for 
any more people to enter the area. I had to loan my phone to people who had left theirs in their bags, and at one 
point had to go and get a man's bag so he wouldn't miss his plane out of Liverpool.<br><br>

I was back doing the Tour de Yorkshire, although a bit further afield this time. After a repeat of the training at the West Yorkshire 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/WVraw8fQD6TfSgUNA">Police training </a>facility near Wakefield, I was assigned to Grosmont in the 
North Yorkshire Moors National Park. I decided to travel over the night before and stay in Glaisdale at Red House Farm B&B, taking in 
some scenery enroute. Instead of going the normal route, north out of Pickering, I turned left and didn't turn left until Aislaby. That 
took me up over <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K6ZXhN1fqfqEYrCj6">Hartoft Rigg</a>, and down into Glaisdale down a very steep and 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/i51s9buM3cgvg8pDA">windy hill</a>. The B&B took a bit of finding, but was very comfy.<br><br>

Had time for a fabulous cooked breakfast, and to tell my fellow guests the best way to see the race, before parking up on the outskirts 
of Grosmont. I made sure my allocated spot was at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RJViqdhQiygz8ygf8">level crossing</a> by 
the station for the steam railway.

The World Rugby Under20 Championships were held in Manchester,using the Ethiad Academy pitch and the AJ Bell stadium. I was at the 
AJ Bell and I was one of the volunteers. I had applied for a rugby specific role 
eg practice pitch attentendent, but was a little dismayed to be assigned to Pitchside Entertainment. Before I could e-mail them telling 
them they could stick the cheer leading pom-poms where the sun don't shine, another lady beat me to it. She was assured that we would 
be working with the professional team who were in charge of all off pitch stuff, including pre-match anthems and flags.<br><br>
