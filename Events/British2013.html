I decided to just do the weekend up at St. Andrews. I got as far as Dundee late on Thursday night, so set off at <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5H4EpXQftoB6rwHq5">
silly o'clock</a> just after <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4PfVJJZXa9gUdWnh6">dawn</a>, to get to St. Andrews for the early starters.
Arrived at the course at just before 6.30am to see Tutta on the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/x6ZRwg7av6Mxx5GN7">practice putting</a> 
green. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aR1FKUvcTDTQvqwVA">LD was also putting</a> and chatting to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/UWXnPgbBdbbzr9He9">Yani</a>. 
Ms Wie was doing her weird <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LiV9wLWr8Xrov4xH9">flat back putting</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/HgnCiYPrPWD334as7">
Natalie Gulbis</a> wasn't wearing a skirt. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/f2bLh8zf9PFnQhnJA">Tutta teed off</a> at 7.15am, and set 
off down the 1st fairway with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/dvAM28jConMpmZzH8">Natalie and Mamiko Higa</a>. As ever at St. Andrews,
you get a great <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/M3vkKS53DuSVj2LL8">close up view</a> of the golfers on the tees, but not so much on 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/q9UAFtqhVaYFrp1h6">the big shared greens</a>.<br><br>
<a href="StandView2.JPG"><img src="StandView2.JPG" width="550" height="403" title="18 Stand" border="0" align="right"></a>

The weather took a definite turn for the worse as they played the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JkeynGFyg2oQWdZN7">4th and 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tBMbfPy8wbRBqAgRA">5th</a>, and it was tissing it down by the time they were out on the loop, 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/K8MkF7r2ZTx3bZn69">playing the 12th</a>. This being Scotland, it was lovely and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9L5ntDn7Z1mdUt3k7">
sunny </a>by the time they got to the 14th. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/NoqktAweiwtftDGL6">Alison Nicholas</a> was out 
commentating and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xeoURnhVowZiGQSY8">Natalie's fiance</a> was following her. Suzann almost disappeared
into a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YrWqMMqt14BgunkJ6">bunker on the 16th</a>. There was quite a wait on the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ME3dadNcuyeYYKjG9">
17th tee</a>. This time, the 17th is being played as it should be, as a par 4, ad with the blind tee shot, things were backing up. The 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MXkqNUDjVPavfWtCA">puddles on the 18th</a> fairway showed how hard it had rained earlier.

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajWWuSZcZx23WvVH8">Sophie Gustafson</a> was playing in the afternoon. Tutta re-appeared after lunch 
to work on her <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/eszgE6UUHjF6pTFU8">putting and to have a coffee with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LHJ4CDw5vULysunZ9">
Lotte Neumann</a>. I had a quick sit in the stand at the back of 18 which affords agood view of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/2zWc35sSCAwXVG8p7">
Chariots of Fire beach</a>. Spotted <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JkqoYTuZDSv6oLmh6">Tutta </a>heading out to dinner. I headed up 
to my hotel on North Street, The Ardgowan Hotel.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">Saturday August 3rd 2013</h1></font></i>

Saturday morning, I had a bit of a lie-on, but not long enough to miss my cooked full Scottish breakfast. Headed out to the driving 
range. Caught up with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/J2haCvXcK6XuPLDg8">Ryan O'Toole</a>, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PytWzSYmU615pTG89">
Paula Creamer</a>, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DzZ58Fn5SpBmRBCx7">Stacy Lewis</a>. Before I could get out on the course and 
see some golf, the wind blew up a real hoolie. Out at the loop, balls were moving around on the greens, and play had to be called off
for the day.<br><br>

Out of the blue, as I walked past a restaurant just off the course on my way back to my hotel, lo and behold, my <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rCyiiqu6uPF9WacJA">
Aussie mates</a> from Evian a few years back were in there having lunch. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Md9GDPsNjn6yBpAp8">Myranwy, 
Mo and another of their friends, Sheila</a>. The wind had subsided a bit by the evening, so I wandered down to the course to have photos 
taken on the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qcaoX6qzNv5F6f5RA">steps of the R&A</a>, on the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/TnsQwXvoDsLasUkX8">
1st tee</a>, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Ec3PqNE4j5y3NEWK6">sitting</a> on the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/NDiHFYzHSEuA7UeBA">
Swilcam Bridge</a>.<br><br>

Everyone had an early start, as a lot of people hadn't started their third round due to the wind postponement the previous day. I 
caught up wih Tutta on the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/7B6BQ89An1KNiYwd7">driving</a> and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YQrc4PUUoAx2SGA67">
chipping range</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/VTnGGSEGm5b67fDb7">Paula Creamer</a> wasn't wearing pink, presumably because she 
was playing the third not fourth round. Hee Young Park and Stacy Lewis were <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5RbsWDhXgsm6zWMi8">
playing together</a>. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/4zJZ6SCABGiHtCxu6">Tutta</a> was playing with Morgan Pressel and they seemed to be <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/QvSkEBYJZNbvLVrX7">
enjoying </a>each <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1WZSNTVf4VB38B6u6">others company</a>. On the 5th Tutta was in one of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aZGFoJ3wMnninuMAA">deep fairway</a>
bunkers. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/b8SBwbLLfM57B5pL9">Axel and Mona</a>, Tutta's parents, were out following. <a href"https://photos.app.goo.gl/RVXV71yvN84x6ji17">
Tutta </a> was not happy with her tee shot on <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LJ13aMzXcV1sQRiK7">11</a>. There was a bit of a wait on 
the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PmgFrot5zx84mvqA9">13th tee</a> before <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/QC1y7phejn7oELCU6">
Tutta hit</a>. Tutta finished off her third round with a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DkYXzqG34s5D2qRu9">birdie</a> on 18.

After lunch, Tutta and Pressel had <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RAADbNr9MLX9XpMy8">changed</a> for round four. I followed them to 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/E3WtyaTaWVSrScu56">the second</a>, but my feet were killing me from having done 18 holes already, so 
I decided to watch the rest of the round on the large <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fiyjhRCECYnb2vRM7">screen TV</a> in the 
spectator village. Tutta was in contention for the win, but her approach to 17 ended up by the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Wj6zqVNapHs2kY8j8">
wall</a> on the Road Hole, and she trudged disconsolatley up the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fiyjhRCECYnb2vRM7">18th fairway</a>. 
She ended up <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/DmdtHNJnVgLpnFf66">tied for 4th</a> with Pressel, three shots behind winner Stacy Lewis. 
For the trophy presentation cue <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/TxepDQsn9Dg1pGYv7">pipe band</a> and
