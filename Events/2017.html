The work outside the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3uUZS6Xp7fYch8iV6">patio and back door</a> at Mum's was finally completed. No more 
waking up and finding the floor an inch deep in water after rain at night. Mum said she could cope putting towels down and washing them each 
day, but it was definitely too much for her. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/a2Le4kkeotnbBTEm8">builders</a>, once they arrived, did a 
great job, and as a plus for Mum, very chatty. A pair of brothers apparently.<br><br>

The Swanettes were on duty on a freezing night at the A J Bell. We took some time off to have our group photo taken with the Premiership
Rugby <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JPxik3qcCu5jAbC39">trophy </a>.<br><br>
<a href="BWB.JPG"><img src="BWB.JPG" width="350" height="553" title="Wheelchair Basketball" border="0" align="left"></a>
February also saw the National Squash Championships back at the National Squash Centre. As ever, much glass cleaning, floor mopping and door 
security. Missed the final day as I was in bed with a shockig cold, but they sent me the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bvZmVUSn8EDvCM477">
group picture</a> they had taken with Laura Massaro and Nick Matthew.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">March 2017</h1></font></i>

Next were the British <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3oQBEYtu9ASM7TC78">Wheelchair Basketball </a>University Championships. The day 
before the weekend, I got an e-mail telling me to show up at 9.30am at the Belle View Sports Village, a new venue for me. Due to low 
volunteer numbers, we were going to be assigned our roles on arrival. I arrived and reported to the reception desk. After a two minute 
briefing, and before getting a cuppa or uniform, I was in charge of the team check-in desk. I had to hand out the numbered bibs and record 
which team members was using which, and which was the impaired team member. The rules are different from Paralympic basketball, to allow 
for more participation. Only one of the 5 team mebers need to be impaired. The others in the team can be able bodied. We were providing 
loan wheelchairs for the competition.<br><br>

Once all the teams had checked in, two hours after arrival, I got a break to have a cuppa and put on my t-shirt before <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xX2cC6LLFnjmFnyS6">
competition started </a>. It turned out when they said volunteer numbers were low, they meant for Saturday, I was the volunteer. I was 
tasked with collecting up the loan wheelchairs post match to ensure they were available for all teams, and collecting the final scorecard 
from the referees and taking them to the organisers in the back who could update the official results on the computer. <br><br>

On Sunday, two more volunteer arrived, one of whom was Gillian from MCRVIP so things weren't quite so hectic. The guys from Anglia Ruskin 
University in Cambridge, were obviously treating the weekend as a weekend away rather than a serious competition. Their impaired team 
member was an extremely good wheelchair basketballer, but the rest of them were not exactly athletic. Thye had a large shared bucket of 
KFC for their lunch. I think they thought sitting in a wheelchair would not require much puff or fitness. By the end of the day, we had to 
push them out to their van in the chairs and tip them into the van.<br><br>

The Tour de Yorkshire was back and I was working on all three stages. I was travelling each day rather than stopping because I was in three 
quite different spots. Day 1 and I was at Garrowby Hill, which is on the A166 between York and Bridlington. Had a Little Chef Olympic 
breakfast enroute for the first time in years. We <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FnAhGaJ9tCppxDXu7">Tourmakers </a>had to meet up at a 
farm towards the top of the hill who offered us parking. The treat of the day was the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D1hH63oaYTgWrsww5">
Pakistan Consulate Bhangra Van </a> in the publicity caravan, which only just made it up the hill, belching smoke and trailing the smell of
burning rubber.<br><br>

Day Two and a very picturesque drive to my spot on the Cote de Lofthouse, as Trapping Hill is known these days in cycling circles. It is in
the Nidderdale area of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, just north of Pately Bridge. We met up at the Crown pub in Lofthouse, but told we 
could park for free at a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1hRDSMCLWmeggKqt5">farmer's field </a>half way up the climb. I positioned myself 
on a bend where the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jbRZanQZTYy34VdY6">incline sharpened</a> considerably. The <a href="ttps://photos.app.goo.gl/BwEh2JEL3EkXcBSm6">
Women's race</a> came through first. A professional photographer picked the same spot, but a little higher up, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/JMnTbwoiCv69fhoMA">
caught me</a> in one of his photos posted to the TDY Twitter feed. Anybody who cycled up got a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FGShpWcxWCK2mZXT9">
great reception</a>.<br><br>

The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/h6V4RceC9mNv6euq7">publicity caravan</a> preceeded the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/s5tWCLZDxWaDyVju5">
men's race</a>, but the Bhangra Van didn't attempt the hill, which was a relief for those of us who had seen it struggle the day before. 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AHm1mTYygM9pKyPH7">Auntie Bessie's Yorkshire Pudding</a> did make it. Day 3 saw me in 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yf8dZPqTCBz24XUs9">Burley-in-Wharfedale </a>. You basically drive past Accent in Skipton, and keep going 
for a bit until you get to Burley. We met up at the Red Lion Pub who were allowing us to park for free. We had to be there early as we were 
early on in the route for the day, and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/upcmmUHSoNxLkwNG6">publicity caravan</a>, peleton and team 
cars flew through at a rate of knots. Having had lunch at the Red Lion, I headed home, and managed to watch the stage finish on the TV.<br><br>

<a href="Test.JPG"><img src="Test.JPG" width="350" height="503" title="Test" border="0" align="left"></a>
June, and we were in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/TpvNLEs66QCU2vZq8">Didsbury</a> for the pre Wimbledon grass court tennis tournament, 
with local girl <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/QRJzp4Ras8D7RF6y9">Naomi Broady</a> as the poster girl for the tournament, which was 
now an International Tennis Federation (ITF) Tennis Circuit tournament, known as the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/W6q2RYorvDCFKtBH9">
Aegon Manchester Trophy </a>. Broady, the 6th seed, made it to the semi-finals, beating the No.1 seed in the quarter finals. She lost to 
the eventual winner, Zarina Diyas from Kazakhstan.<br><br>

July saw the start of the T20 Blast matches at Old Trafford. Sunday 16th saw Derbyshire bat first and make 152 for 8 off their 20 overs. In 
reply, Lancashire made 155 for 5 in just under 19 overs. The following Sunday, Durham were the visitors. Lancashire made 174 for 5, and
restricted Durham to 143 for 8.<br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">August 2017</h1></font></i>

Old Trafford staged the 4th Test Match between England and South Africa. As ever with a Test Match there was a different entertainment group
each day. The cricketers on stilts are regular visitors, but this time we has <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jeYqzqZ4aZih3aRN8">
W G Grace</a>. The mariachi band proved very popular, but they seemed to only have three sogs in their repertoire, including 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5w9PYbzyzzMEuq8EA">"Ystalyfera"</a>. The new Hilton Garden Hotel at the ground had been running a competition. 
The prize each day was a free lunch served on <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/tnNt2qvTfDCLaWUk6">double beds</a>, in the space where extra seats alongside Stand A would normally be. Sounds good,
but eating in full view of the crowd was somewhat intimidating, and eating on a bed is not the easiest thing to do. At the weekend, the fancy
dress competition takes places, and the winners were the fifteen guys who came as <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/hQNhd1LvtFMNC7gw9">
post boxes</a>. The <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1BuBtwMMAUYpucAJ8">stilted drummers</a> were a very <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qBEXHw2XpLKh6D83A">
popular option</a>. I did manage to sit in the back of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/waav2C33DXJA9oJ77">C stand</a> to catch some of 
the action. The T20 game against the Worcs Rapids was a late night game and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/nMpABhHP6AGXWdV39">flame 
throwers</a> were <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/atfHPcxxqkFwSZos9">incredibly hot</a> to be close to. Two days later Lancashire lost
to the Birmingham Bears and the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/jzUcRJTEnyX3R8y8A">Queen's Baton</a> from the Gold Coast was visiting 
Old Trafford. <br><br>

<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">September 2017</h1></font></i>

England played an <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/M7ezvGWP9teCBWKb9">ODI </a>against the West Indies, so we were on duty in September 
when it was a little chilly for cricket. There was a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ysFT6KnLLYe38ed77">fabulous band</a> that moved 
around the concourse throughout the evening. They even played the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/xVrEe8rJQSeVaTbL8">BBC Cricket theme</a>
as the fan left at the end of the game.<br><br>

Feeling a little jaded with the pain that was dealing with the adult idiots in Mersey Weaver Scouts, Owen invited me along to the selection 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/WhxL1PZeHuMN4iUx7">event</a> for the World Scout Jamboree(WSJ) contingent. I was a non-voting helping 
hand. It was fascinating to watch the young people undertake the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/mT7u79BmapepN3P68">tasks </a>their 
groups had been assigned. They had been told it was more important to do the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/XJWr925feH5vxWH96">task </a>
in the right way, than to succeed, teamwork and communication being the most important elements. They also had to 
undertake an interview with a three person panel. All the voting adults then congregated, and the 10 successful young people selected, 
along with three ranked alternatives. Five of the young people stood out and were selected with little discussion. There were none that 
were definitely ruled out, but a few that doubts were expressed about. A set of twins had applied, both of whom were strongly favoured to 
be selected pre event, but in the end, only one was picked. He was the quieter, less cocky individual. <br><br>
<a href="Squash.JPG"><img src="Squash.JPG" width="550" height="353" title="Squash Champs" border="0" align="right"></a>
<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">December 2017</h1></font></i>

The World Squash Championships, both Men's and Women's, were held in Manchester just before <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ShNDck4LNDn4E4s18">
Christmas</a>. The first few days were played at the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AJ5ukm12daETLK357">National Squash Centre</a>, then 
we moved to Manchester Central Convention Complex for the Quarter-finals onwards. Tha's the new bit of G-Mex. It was lovely to spend time 
in the nearby <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/AGEfeamb4jfa39faA">Albert Square Christmas Market</a>, when we had spare time in the 
middle of the day. We got to watch quite a bit of the squash as we were often on crowd control, especially at G-Mex, around the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/37NC5YNHZ6eoe9Uy6">glass court</a>. The weather was freezing outside, we had snow at times, but the 
inside of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/aAa8oUAb9ueQnggv6">arena</a> with all the lights for the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/TXDq3Wbj7Ym9aQLE9">
TV coverage</a> was warm. The Welsh lass, Tesni Evans, who was seeded 16, beat 4th seed Laura Massaro of England, to make it to the 
quarter-finals, but lost in 3 games. Both finals were all <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fnzNg4bcLrKZcxiEA">Egyptian affairs</a>, with 
the men's final being played by two brothers. After working all day, each day, by the time I got home for Christmas, I came down with a 
wicked cold that stayed with me for days.<br><br>
