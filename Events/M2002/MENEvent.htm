<h3>Games party tribute to volunteers</h3>
THOUSANDS of Commonwealth Games volunteers packed in to the Manchester Evening News Arena for a star-studded celebration. The army of about 
10,000 workers of all ages and backgrounds came together were publicly honoured for their commitment to make the Manchester 2002 the greatest 
Commonwealth Games ever.<br><br>

Known collectively as Crew 2002, the volunteer force behind the XV11 Commonwealth Games moved into overdrive with just 94 days to go.<br><br>

Royal party guests Prince Edward and his wife Sophie entered the M.E.N. Arena to loud cheers and applause. In a rousing speech Prince Edward 
told them: &quot;Your knowledge, your confidence, your friendliness, are key to our visitors perceptions of Manchester and the Games. The 
British public has proved my faith in the support and the interest for the Manchester Games by buying tickets at a faster rate than even 
the fabled Sydney Olympics. The world will be watching, but I am 100 per cent confident that you can do it, and both of us will be here 
in Manchester throughout to see it.&quot;<br><br>

The evening was hosted by Stars In Their Eyes presenter Matthew Kelly. He said: &quot;I'm a Manchester man and seeing all these people 
who want to do something special for the city makes me very proud.&quot;  Also in the audience were invited celebrity guests, including 
stars from Coronation Street, Brookside and Emmerdale.<br><br>

Paralympic champion Tanni Grey Thompson, paid tribute to the volunteers. She said: &quot;The volunteers are the people who make the 
Games work and add something invaluable to the success. They make a huge difference.&quot; <br><br>

I was there and it was a good night out. Could have done without the Royals but the rest of the entertainment was fine. The African 
singing and dancing troupe were worth seeing on their own. Heather Small was on hand at the end to get the MEN rocking.<br><br>
