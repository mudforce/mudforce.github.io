FOR two glorious weeks it was home to over 5,000 athletes and officials from across the world. Today, apart from the cleaners, the athletes' village at Fallowfield was deserted.<br><br>

With the last of the athletes bidding farewell yesterday, their rooms are being turned back over to students of Manchester University.<br><br>

They were waved off with some sadness by volunteers. Crossing patrol warden Susan Lockton, 57, from Droylsden, said: "I'm really sorry to see all the athletes go, I've had such a fantastic time."<br><br>

Amanda Dale, a psychiatric nurse from Knutsford, worked in the athletes' telephone section of the village.&nbsp; She said: "It's a bit like a bereavement now that everyone has gone, it's
very sad.<br> <br>

"Most of the athletes were friendly, but the Canadians were the best, they had a wonderful attitude." Eddie McCann, Charlotte Postlethwaite and Barbara Sidebotham worked as day pass
centre assistants.<br><br>

Eddie said: " We've had a great time working here and we even met the Queen."<br><br>

Charlotte said: "Being part of the Commonwealth Games has been a once in a lifetime experience and it's something I'll never forget."<br><br>

Barbara said: "I will certainly miss being here because it has been a great atmosphere."<br><br>

Stephen Peel, who ran the hairdressing salon in the village, said: "It has been superb meeting all the athletes from different countries. It's something I will always remember. The event has done Manchester proud."
