<h3>Commonwealth Games Volunteer Medal</h3>
<a href="2002Medal1.JPG"><img src="2002Medal1s.JPG" width="498" height="369" alt="" border="0" align="left"></a>
The Commonwealth Games Commemorative medal was given to the 26,000 people who made the Games happen - volunteers, staff, athletes, technical officials and the cast of the Opening and Closing Ceremonies.<br><br>

The medal, which is made of silver and produced at the Royal Mint, comes in a special presentation box with a card inside describing the significance of its unique design.<br><br>

On the front of the medal, which is not for sale, is the Games Spirit of Friendship logo featuring three figures and is
similar in design to the Athlete Prize Medals.<br><br>

The design on the reverse side contains images which depict Manchester' unique history and industrial heritage. The symbols include:-<br><br>

Roman Road (Cobbles): The Romans first occupied Manchester in AD79 building a fort called Mamucium, which gave the city its name. The remains of this fort can still be found in the Castlefield area.<br><br>

Cotton Flower: Manchester is known worldwide as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution and the rapid growth of the cotton industry played a vital part in this development. Cotton flowers are to be found throughout the masonry, ironwork and stained glass of the Town Hall<br><br>

Water and Railways : Rivers, the first canals and early railways played crucial roles in the expansion of the cotton industry in Manchester during the Industrial Revolution. Manchester was home to the first passenger railway station in the
world<br><br>

The Internet Highway : The first computer "Baby" was designed and built at the University of Manchester.<br><br>

Bee : The bee was first adopted by Manchester in the 19th century as a symbol of the industrious nature of the City and its people. Worker bees are featured in the mosaic floors in Manchester Town Hall and throughout the city on street furniture.<br><br>

The oval shape linking these symbols together is a representation of an aerial view of the Manchester Stadium.<br><br>
