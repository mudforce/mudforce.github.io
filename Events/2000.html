Another Page & Moy holiday, with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/t1p9xUyJowL39RwB7">Mum, Dad and Jean</a>, this time to Oporto and the 
Douro Valley. We flew to Oporto with Sian, our UK rep. She was a History of Art graduate studying for a PhD, and was with us for the whole 
trip. We also had a Portuguese rep, Leonore. All trips under Portuguese law have to have a qualified Portugeuese tourist guide. Day 1 we 
had a part bus/part <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/VSa4L2k1yNib38Tz8">walking tour</a> of Oporto, including <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/a8uP4Lonb7TzxBnE8">
a stop</a> at the very pretty <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/uXCfhna458tpf1bv7">Mercado do Bolh&atilde;o</a>. We also had a tour of a 
port house located in <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/yQySaNMqk84ykPi58">Vila Nova de Gaia</a> on the opposite side of the river from 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6oi12BpszEPaWaVz8">Cais da Ribeira</a>. The tour included <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/rdE6kk85aPWwdhpA6">
lunch</a>. There was a good view of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8iLMWaRtass56DuK8">Ponte de Dom Lu&iacute;s I</a>.<br><br>

We then went by bus up the Douro to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RiUpyuaddLypd5rLA">Peso da R&eacute;gua</a> and embarked on a 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/g9RQFJTuUWprQmiu7">boat trip</a> further up the river. We passed one of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SSYV2pjtATjWhimdA">
Barcos Rabelos,</a> which are the traditional Portuguese wooden cargo boats used to transport people and goods along the Douro River. There 
are a number of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/amW8apEdSFRyFdHS8">locks on the river</a>, and we went through the spectacular 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qgYWwh6n3jPkvd7EA">Barragem Carrapatelo,</a> which is a concrete gravity dam, where the river forms the 
border line between the districts of Porto and Viseu. We <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RTGc5bRppTfti4yRA">cruised up</a> the river 
to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1PuU9z1vcSyNEtuK8">Pinh&atilde;o</a>. Our hotel was <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vqcjFzXsDvXu9AhN6">
on the Douro </a>riverside, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8EYxd5MXB8RPCXeTA">the Vintage House Hotel</a>. This was an 18th-century 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/PvKH8oxkHz7K7i8aA">wine lodge</a> and converted into a hotel by port makers Taylor's.<br><br>

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Q7vYdz85diDYjQco6">Sian and Leonore were obviously friends from previous trips and they had decided on 
a possible change of itinerary. We were given a choice of our original destination, or Guimar&atilde;es, which was their recommendation. 
We voted for Guimar&atilde;es, which has the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/3ySELTSQxjoafi3NA">Palace of the Dukes of Braganza</a>, 
and is a UNESCO World Heritage city. We took a look at the outside of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/p5NDXppEQgrgWXRa9">
Palace</a>, but whilst the rest of the group went inside for a tour, we went to a local cafe for a coffee/white wine.<br><br>

Our next trip was to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6o4ApbZXADLXp2Zg9">Casa de Mateus</a>. This is the palace that features on the 
wine label for Mateus Rose, and used to be <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/1pRoMpXrbwYY7HJu7a"> winery</a>. We had a look around the 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YkhBUV9yuybTxeWs8">ornamental gardens</a>.<br><br> 
<a href="MeMaVilla.jpg"><img src="MeMaVilla.jpg" width="500" height="353" title="Me and Mum" border="0" align="right"></a>
From there we went to Lamego, location of the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8L55jhCAYMZvWYtZ8">
Santu&atilde;rio Nossa Senhora dos Rem&eacute;dios.</a> This sanctuary has a monumental <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/mn9G21HCDz57dMtK6">
Baroque staircase</a> made of 686 steps in nine separate sections. Pilgrims are supposed to ascend this staircase on their kneees. Mum, 
Jean and I all decided to stay on the bus with Dad and get a lift to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5xLaWfaUWEeamarv8">the top</a> 
and not climb the staircase! There was also a tour of the Museu de Lamego, which had a wide ranging display of exhibits. They take great 
pride in their paintings of Vasco Fernandes, more popularly known as Gr&atilde;o Vasco, and the collection of Flemish tapestries. 
Gr&atilde;o Vasco's altarpiece was particularly interesting, and was what caused me to start an Open University Humanities course when 
we got home. The more energetic of us went on a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/goKUref4bzdibkZ19">small boat</a> 
trip on the river. There was also a trip up <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/du9DjsrLwanhmXj88">into the hills</a> for a long lunch 
sampling the local white wine made from grapes harvested from the vineyard we were at.<br><br>

Another trip to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/uT3QGF386rnNsxqb8">Dick's villa </a>in Carvoiero with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/a9vAcjq5GiaZCpcP8">
Mum, Dad and Jean</a>. The weather on this trip was quite changeable with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/FnRTH9QaY1jVk4jQ7">rough 
seas</a> for a couple of days. They had completed the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5CGwNEAFVADfHwE17">new marina</a> in Praia da 
Rocha. We had another trip to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/i7tUv72wgt6eoesV7">Burgau, </a>fast becoming one of our 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KtyvfPknih6pYSJ99">favourite spots<a> to visit.<br><br>
