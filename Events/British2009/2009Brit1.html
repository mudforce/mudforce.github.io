<i><h1><font size="4" face="Verdana">Women's British Open - Tuesday July 28th - Pro Am</h1></font></i>

<font size="3" face="Verdana">The journey to Lytham St Annes was great, taking about an hour. As I drove towards the public parking the rain 
started and the weather looked very threatening. I put on both my fleeces and my cagoule, and wandered onto the course to see who was playing 
in the Pro Am. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/bWkpbP9VZuW7xA27A">Anna Nordqvist</a> was playing the 13th but they had another pro 
Marianne Skarpnord, the Norwegian in their group.<br><br>
<a href="LD5.JPG"><img src="LD5.JPG" width="550" height="453" title="LD 7th Tee" border="0" align="left"></a>
Wandered over to the area between the sixth green and seventh tee. Waterproof trousers had to be donned as the rain was getting heavier. Saw 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/LPxZWPCQtCTMe8PM9">Brittany Lincicombe</a> teeing off on the seventh. Next up on the 6th was <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5qxsUGeFAoXhaSxq7">
Cristie Kerr's</a> group. One of the amateur caddies was obviously a friend and not a regular. He was desperately trying to keep dry by 
wearing a towel on his head. Black rainwear seems to be the colour of choice. One of the guys in Kerr's group played a fantastic bunker shot 
and she was very congratulatory. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/a58o1Betwx3y2pFXA">Karrie Webb</a> was an exception to the all black rule 
having a cream section to her jacket. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/YBoYiRKrsEJLm5D76">Natalie Gulbis</a> was next and it was back to 
all black. One of the guys in her group was a nightmare. I was standing alongside him on the 7th tee and when he finished his swing he was 
facing me!! The ball went about 50 yards into the right rough nowhere near the start of the fairway. A long day in store for Natalie.<br><br>

Tutta was along next, and was getting along great with her group. As they went past me over to the 7th tee one of her playing partners did a 
double take. I didn't think I looked that stupid. It became obvious that he, Tutta and one of the others in the group were talking about me on 
the tee. Eventually, one of them wandered over to me and said "My friend says he thinks he saw you at Evian last week". I confirmed that I was 
there, and he wanted to know if I went to all the tour events. I had to explain that it was just the two weeks in Europe. He wanted to know my 
favourite player. I told him I was really an Annika fan but quite liked Tutta as well.<br><br>

After he hit an awful tee shot (and shouted something obviously rude in a foreign language) Tutta took him to one side and gave him a detailed 
<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/2hSd2eW6YnnYvRpv9">technical swing lesson</a>. He hit another tee shot and this time is was a thing of beauty. Laura Diaz had a wooly hat over her baseball cap and 
seemed to be enjoying herself with her pro am partners. Morgan Pressel was having a ball with her lot. I think they were all Americans and 
they were talking US sport. I think they were talking about NHL ice hockey and the recent Stanley Cup finals. One of them told me that the 
course was winning and the only thing to do was have a cigar. He proceeded to light up a huge Cuban.<br><br>

<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Hs1m8TGV6aqvFpWC9">Karen Stupples</a> broke the all black rule by wearing a red rain jacket. As she passed 
me on the way to the 7th tee she recognized me, said "Hi",and asked if we had had a good journey back from Evian. Bobby (caddie/hubby) also 
recognized me, looked surprised to see me out there in the rain and said "Are you crazy?" I confirmed that I was! <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Z8WXz1MnZW7KavFe8">
Momoko Ueda</a> completely broke the all black rule by wearing salmon pink top and bottom. Terry nodded in acknowledgment of my presence. 
Kent Nilsson was cheating. He was pushing the bag on a cart. He looked cold, wet and a little weary. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/SmKSkMqNdZVAfinh9">
Alfie </a>got a lovely birdie which was just as well as the other ladies playing with her were really struggling. One of them narrowly missed 
me by hitting way right from 15 yards away.<br><br>

As usual, <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/q1j6hsj35psAsbQa7">LD </a>seemed to be enduring rather than enjoying her Pro Am round. She was 
walking way ahead of her playing partners. She made a very casual birdie on 6 and wandered off to the 7th tee. She did her usual thing getting 
an iron out to dig up a <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/8M6aqczqbm7a23Yf9">lump of tee</a> on which to put her tee ball. The group in 
front was holding her up, so she started trying to <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZyJzUxyQENHXgheb6">tennis serve a golf ball</a> using 
her driver. Thank God the train wasnt coming when she finally made contact and sent the ball sailing across the railway line.<br><br>
<a href="XtinaBunker5.JPG"><img src="XtinaBunker5.JPG" width="550" height="453" title="Xtina Bunker" border="0" align="right"></a>
Wandered in towards the clubhouse. Caught up with <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/vQonGUBfrNnmJWgM9">Lorena </a>waiting to tee off on the 
18th. She was sporting blue rainwear. Back at the practice ground bought myself a bacon roll and sat in the grandstand at the driving range 
to eat it. <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Vre8uPzKkc5kJW599">Xtina Kim </a>was practising next to Soph and chatting away as usual. 
ShanShan Feng looked a tad silly as she was not only dressed head to toe in orange but was hitting on the range with her hood up. Wandered 
over to the grandstand by the 1st tee where there were a load of golfers waiting to tee off. Vicky Hurst was there along with her Mum who is 
supposed to be as bad as the Wie's. She was tossing grass into the air to test the wind and took the yardage book to point out something to 
the caddie who was feigning interest. She has in the past spent time pointing out where not to hit it which doesn't engender positive 
thoughts.<br><br>

At the chipping green, I found <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/m3doT1AazoALHt4h9">Xtina Kim</a> in one of the pot bunkers. She seemed to 
be, as she said herself, "digging to make sandcastles". She was laughing all the time as she and her caddie were trying to come up with the 
most difficult spot in the bunker. The putting green was now crowded, and saw Portland John standing by the caddie master area. I welcomed him to the lovely weather at the British, and he pointed 
out that coming from Portland he was used to weather. He said he'd told his bag, Soo Yun Kang, to get all her practicing in today because 
Wednesday was going to be dreadful. They had played with Ai Miyazato who played 9 holes being constantly followed and interviewd by a 
Japanese TV crew. Once they disappeared she apparently played really well. Whilst watching Xtina chatting with all and sundry rather than 
putting on the putting green, the heavens absolutely opened. Decided it was time to make the trip back back out to the car.<br><br>
