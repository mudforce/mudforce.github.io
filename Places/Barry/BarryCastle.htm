<h3>Barry Castle</h3>
<h4>near Porthkerry Country Park, Barry Town, Vale of Glamorgan ST 102673</h4>

<p><IMG align=left src="t.gif" width="44" height="54"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><IMG align=right alt="Barry Castle" src="castle.jpg" width="257" height="159">
his small, 
two-storey gatehouse and the adjacent walls of a hall, now pleasantly landscaped and restored, are all that remain 
of the seat of the de Barry family. The castle was really little more than a small fortified manor house, built in the 13th and 14th centuries to replace 
an earlier earthwork.</font> 

<P>By the late 13th century the castle had two stone buildings on the east and west sides of a courtyard, but nothing now remains of these above ground. Early in the 14th century the 
castle was strengthened by the addition of a large hall and gatehouse on its south side, and the ruins of these can be seen today.</font> 

<P><IMG align=left alt="Barry Castle" src="castlebarry.jpg" width="287" height="159">

<p>The gatehouse passage is arched, with a portcullis groove on the east side. As well as a portcullis it had a drawbridge and double doors. A small room above, whose outer wall and arched window survive, held the portcullis windlass and also probably a chapel. Behind the gate passage is a rectangular room with a blocked staircase on the southeast corner and an arrow slit on the east wall. The walls of the hall block to the west are much lower, with a low arched doorway and an arrow slit on the north side. The hall itself was on the first floor, and was heated by a fireplace on the north wall. There was a narrow mural stair in the southeast corner on to a wall-walk on the curtain wall, and a door, the bottom part of which is visible, in the east was leading to the portcullis chamber/chapel. There is evidence that the hall was roofed with Cornish slate, and had green glazed ridge tiles.</font>
