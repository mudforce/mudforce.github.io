<h3>Barry & Local Area</h3>

<p><img border="0" alt="St.Nicholas'Church" src="stnicchurch.jpg" align="left" width="250" height="150"></p>

<p>A number of Town Walking Trails have been devised which enable visitors to view the historic sites in the local area. One of these, relating to 'Old Barry', takes in the remains of <a class=visited href="barrycastle.htm"> Barry Castle</a> (13th-14th centuries), the 16th century yeoman's house of Cold Knap Farm, <a class=visited href="St.Nichs.htm">  St.Nicholas Church</a> (of 1876) with memorials to many old Barry families, the roman naval depot at The Knap (3rd century) and Barry Old Village whose houses include Rose Cottage (pre 1 600) and the terrace of whitewashed cottages built by the Romilly Estate in 1862. A second town trail, entitled 'Old Cadoxton', takes a walk around the Old Village centre, with its 18th and 19th century houses and with the medieval church of St. Cadoc.

<p>Outside Barry itself there are many beautiful and interesting places to visit.&nbsp;East along the coast, between Barry and the neighbouring resort of Penarth, is the attractive village of Sully with a secluded beach that looks across to Sully Island which can be reached on foot at low tide. Close by and also offering pleasant bathing is Swanbridge beach.</p>

<p>Inland is <a class=visited href="cosmeston_lakes.htm">Cosmeston Lakes Country Park</a>, which was once a derelict limestone quarry.&nbsp; It has been transformed into an outstanding attraction for waterfowl with areas of woodland and nature walks.&nbsp; Included within the park are the excavations by Glamorgan Gwent Archaeological Trust and the
Medieval Village of Cosmeston, which has been reconstructed as a tourist attraction and educational resource.&nbsp; The village, deserted before the end of the 14th century, was rediscovered in 1982 and many medieval buildings have been excavated and restored to recreate the medieval village atmosphere.</p>

<p>Cardiff, the capital city of the Welsh principality, is quickly and easily reached from Barry and has a great deal to interest visitors. In its very centre, next to the main shopping area, is the splendid <a class=visited href="cardiffcastle.htm"> Cardiff Castle,</a> whilst at the northern edge of the city is <a class=visited href="castellcoch.htm"> Castell Coch</a>. <a class=visited href="museum_of_welsh_life.htm" target="_blank"> The Museum of Welsh Life</a>, <a href="http://www.llandaffcathedral.org.uk/">Llandaff Cathedral</a>, the <a href="http://www.wmc.org.uk/">Wales Millenium Centre</a>, <a href="http://www.stdavidshallcardiff.co.uk/english/index.asp">St. David's Hall</a>, the <a href="http://www.newtheatrecardiff.co.uk/english/index.asp">New Theatre</a>, the Cardiff International Arena and of course, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millenium_Stadium">Millennium Stadium</a> are all features of Cardiff.
