<h3>Cosmeston Lakes Country Park & Medieval Village</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/living/environment/countryside/cosmeston_lakes.aspx">Cosmeston Lakes Country Park</a> had its origins with the advent of limestone quarrying in the early part of this Century. Quarrying for limestone commenced on the southern side of Lavernock Road in the 1890's. By the 1920's increasing difficulties experienced on the south side of Lavernock Road meant a transfer of quarrying to the north side in what is now Cosmeston Lakes Country Park.</p>

<p>The limestone quarried at the site was used for the production of cement. After the first world war building boom, peak production reached 175,000 tons/annum. Work in the northern 
quarries ceased shortly after 1962 with the cement company vacating all premises in 1970.</p>

<p>The abandonment of the site in the early sixties left an area of complete dereliction. In 1964 Penarth Urban District Council, the leaseholders, obtained permission to tip household 
rubbish in the north west quarry hole, this continued during the 1970's.</p>

<p>In 1968 the Countryside Act gave local authorities power to implement the 1966 White Paper 'Leisure in the Countryside'. The Vale of Glamorgan Borough Council decided that this 
derelict quarry site would be ideal for reclamation and renovation into an area which would combine recreation and conservation. A work programme of tree planting and landscaping began in 1978 and the project was completed in 1982 and gave access to a total of 220 acres of woodland, calcareous grassland and wetlands, some 46ha being designated a S.S.S.I (Site of Special Scientific Interest) protecting the rare and diverse plant and animal species.</p>

<p> Within the boundaries of the Country Park is the restored Medieval Village, where visitors can step back in  time to the year 1350, a troubled period in the history between the English and Welsh. The village grew out of a fortified manor constructed around the 12th Century by the Costentin family, who were among the first Norman invaders of Wales.. The remains of this community were discovered and excavated during the 1980's by a team of archaeologists working for the Local Authority who owned the land. As the excavations progressed it was realised that the site presented a unique opportunity to interpret and bring to life the history of Wales! The information gathered by the archaeologists was used to plan a program of reconstruction that has made Cosmeston a heritage project unique in Britain! Now visitors to Cosmeston can see the excavated buildings and gardens re-created, costumed villagers working the land and livestock of the middle ages roaming the paddocks and fields. You can experience medieval life by taking a tour of the village
with a costumed guide.</p>
