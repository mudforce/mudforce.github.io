<h3>Barry's History 1</h3>

<p>Barry, as we now see it, only really began to grow with the building of the docks in 1884. However, people had been living in this part of South Wales since long before that. The
encroachment of the sea to form what is now the Bristol Channel happened about 6500 years ago in the Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) period. Preserved trees and peat deposits were found during the construction of Barry Docks belonging to this period. Barry's history can be traced back to the time of the first farmers of the Neolithic (New Stone Age) period. Several fine polished axe-heads of this era have been found near Barry.<br>

<p> Bronze Age burial mounds and cremation of Beaker folk have been found at Cold Knap and Friars Point. Iron Age hill fort settlements are also in evidence, especially at the Bulwarks
 at Porthkerry. A possible Early Iron Age farmstead dating from the 4th century  BC was discovered during the construction of the College of FE off Colcot Road.<br>

Although the Roman invasion of Britain began in A.D. 43 under the Emperor Claudius, it was not until A.D. 55-60 AD that the 20th Legion began  to capture the territory of the Silures of SE Wales. Evidence for Roman occupation in Barry has been observed at both St. Baruc's Chapel and St. Nicholas' Church, where re-used Roman tiles and bricks were incorporated into the fabric of both buildings. At the Knap they built what is thought to have been a large Naval base and supply depot for their Bristol Channel Fleet which may be unique in Roman Wales,
perhaps in Britain. It seems to have been erected towards the end of the 3rd century A.D.

<p>The name of Barry derives from St. Baruc , who lived on the Island in pre-Norman times and was drowned in the Bristol Channel. A church was built on a headland above the harbour that became a shrine containing his remains. In the 12th century , the church was moved and rebuilding continued until the 14th century. It remained in use until after 1558 but was a ruin by 1700. The ruins can be seen just to the south of Redbrink Road.<br>

<p>Cadoxton, too, takes its name from an early saint, St. Cadoc, and it is around the medieval church of St. Cadoc that the old village grew up. The church still survives, as do some of the older village houses.
