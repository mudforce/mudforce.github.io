<h3>All Saints Church, Barry</h3>
<h2>All Saints Church Construction Details</h2>

<h4>Materials</h3>

<p>The Blue Lias Limestone used in the building of All Saints Church came from the local Nantalwg and Castle Farm quarries. The architect's 
specifications gave very clear instructions to the contractor as to how he was to proceed at Nantalwg:</p>
<img src="church.jpg" width="439" height="294" alt="" border="0" align="left">
<p><i>The stone required for the building, and external shoddy work, can be quarried at the Nantalwg Quarry. A royalty of 3d per yard will 
be charged by the Estate, and the stone is to be properly stacked and measured before carting away. The Contractor will be required to 
work the quarry in a proper manner and to the satisfaction of the Estate Agent. The ground over which the stone will be carted from the 
Quarry to the Beggarswell Road will be fenced in at the cost of the Estate, but the contractor will have to form a rough road for carting 
with stone from the Quarry, and to fill in the ruts etc. so as to enable him to get his carts out.</i></p>

<p>The Bathstone for the Nave Arcading came from the Corsham Down quarries in Wiltshire. It was brought by rail in huge blocks which were 
shaped on the site. Much of the timber used in the roof came to the Docks from Russia and Canada. The Buildings Committee originally 
intended bench pews for the seating but economy obliged them to have chairs which, incredible though it may seem now, cost only four 
shillings and sixpence.</p>
 
<h4>The Tower and Bells</h3>

<img src="All_Saints_Church.JPG" width="578" height="410" alt="" border="0" align="right"><p>The 74ft high Tower with its 135 steps 
commands a truly magnificent view not only of the local urban area but of the coastline on both sides of the Bristol Channel. The Clock 
and Peal of Ten Bells were installed in 1946 as a War Memorial and Thanksgiving for Peace. Cast at the Croydon foundry of Johnson and 
Gillett, the bells hand &quot;dead&quot;, the clappers only being operated by an electro-pneumatic mechanism. The Base Bell carries the 
name of the Rector in 1946, the Rev. W.N. Peregrine and the two wardens, J.A. Grace and A.H. Lawrence. In a preliminary letter to the 
Rev. W.N. Peregrine in 1946, the Managing Director of the Croydon foundry reminded him that a licence might be needed for the 
&quot;architectural work&quot; necessary before the bells and clock were installed. Such were the shortages and controls of the early 
post-war period!</p>
