<h3>All Saints Church, Barry</h3>
<h2>Completion of All Saints Part 1</h2>

<p>It soon became evident that the cost of what was involved was far more than the money available, even though the Romilly family, as Patrons of the Living, contributed substantially. 
The Building Committee reluctantly acknowledged that the new church would have to be built in two parts.</p>

<P>In September 1906, the tender of a local builder, Mr H.S. Rendell for the first part of the contract, to include the Nave, North Aisle and Porch, amounting to ?3,707 5<i>s</i>
8<i>d</i>, was accepted. The contractor immediately started the demolition of the coastguard station to make way for the  foundations of the new church.</p>
 
<p>By early 1907, building work had progressed sufficiently for a Foundation Stone to be laid on the outside of the north-west porch. The ceremony was performed on Wednesday, 6<sup>th</sup> February 1907, by Mr. Samuel Henry Romilly, a Patron of the Living. A short service was held at St. Nicholas Church and a procession of the Lord Bishop of Llandaff, clergy, choir, church officers and parishioners walked to the new site. As a token of the occasion Mr. Romilly received a mallet inlaid in gold from the architect
and a silver trowel from the builder. After the ceremony, the procession re-formed and proceeded to the Church Hall in St. Nicholas Road where tea was provided and an address was given by the Lord Bishop.</p>

<p>A month after the laying of the foundation stone it was decided that work on the South Aisle, as well as the North Aisle, should proceed. The wall of the South Aisle was re-designed to take a stained glass window donated by the Countess of Dunmore, a friend of Rector Stewart, and his wife, the Lady Beatrice Stewart.</p>

<p class=centered>The Consecration of the first part of All Saints Church took place on Wednesday 29<sup>th</sup> April, 1908. The Lord Bishop of Llandaff officiated. The first part cost £7,450. The east end archway of the church, beyond which the Chancel, Vestries and Tower were to be built later was boarded up and the timber  covered by a large blue curtain.</p>
