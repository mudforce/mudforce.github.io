<h3>The Homfrays</h3>
<p>Francis Homfray was a successful iron-master from Stourbridge. He arrived in Merthyr Tydfil about 1782, and leased a forge at Cyfartha from <a href="Bacon.htm">Anthony Bacon</a>. In 1784 he sold his interest in Cyfartha and bought parts of Penydarren and a large tract of land known as Pwllyrhwyaid. Hethus obtained what were probably the richest iron-ore deposits in the district, but coal was not so plentiful, as the Dowlais Company held the coal rights of the area. He erected his works in the valley of Morlais,and they were known as the Penydarren Works. His three sons, Jeremiah, Thomas and Samuel were given control of the undertaking, and by 1786, were giving employment to an increasing number of men. Of the three brothers, Jeremiah and Samuel took the greater interest in the works. They were willing to experiment in order to improve the quality of the iron. The lack of coal hampered them in their work, and often involved them in quarrels with the Guests.

<p>Samuel Homfray became sole manager in 1789, and managed the works well. It was he who saw the genius of Richard Trevethick, and suggested the construction of the canal to Cardiff, subscribing ?40,000 towards its cost. Samuel Homfray proved a sympathetic employer, and people in distress always found him a ready helper.

<p>The works at Penydarren continued to prosper until 1859, when they were closed. Many attempts to restart them were made by those who had shares in the company, but in spite of every effort the Penydarren works fell into decay.</p>
