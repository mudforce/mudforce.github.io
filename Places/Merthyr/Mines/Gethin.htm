<h3>Gethin Colliery, Abercanaid</h3>
<p>Situated near the Cardiff - Merthyr canal at Abercanaid, near Merthyr, it was sunk in 1849 by William Crawshay. It had two 
winding shafts, Upper and Lower pits, Nos. 1 and 2 respectively, both about 120 yards deep. There was also a shallower shaft use 
for ventilation, which was by furnace. Yet another shaft was kept for pumping only. The colliery produced coking coal, which supplied 
Crawshay's furnaces at Cyfartha.

<p>On February 19th 1862, an explosion occurred here in the four feet seam killing 47 men and boys. Naked lights were in general 
use with safety lamps issued to men working in stalls where gas had been found. At the inquest doubt was cast on the adequacy of 
the ventilation and the jury held John Moody, the general manager responsible. He was bailed to appear at the Assizes on a charge 
of Manslaughter, but the Grand jury at the Assizes declared there was no case to answer and he was freed with no restrictions. 
Another explosion on the 20th of December 1865, this time killing 36 men and boys. At the inquest the jury found John Moody, to have 
been culpably negligent in discharging his duties. Once again he was summoned to appear before the Grand jury at the Assizes. On this 
occasion he was indicted, but on the order of the Judge he was acquitted, although he was obliged to mount a defence. He was found 
not guilty. 

<p>From the Inspector of Mines list 1896, Gethin No. 2 was then owned by the Crayshaw Brothers, producing steam coal and employing 
308 men. By 1908 the employment number had risen to 500. Coal production ceased in the 1920's and it was used as a pumping station 
until its closure in 1947.
