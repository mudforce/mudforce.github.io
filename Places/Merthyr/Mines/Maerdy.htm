<h3>Maerdy Colliery</h3>
<img src="MardyNo12.jpg" width="500" height="272" alt="Maerdy Nos. 1 and No. 2, circa 1909" border="0" align="left"><p>Two men from 
Brecon, Mordecai Jones (who also owned Mountain Ash Level) and Wheatley Cobb started Maerdy No.1 and No. 2 in 1875. They reached the 
Abergorki seam in December 1876. In 1877 the owners took the name of Locket's Merthyr Company. The following year the shafts were 
deepened, the reach the steam coal seams including the Two Feet Nine, Four Feet, and Six Feet seams at 500 yards.On the 23rd of 
December 1885, an explosion occurred at this colliery killing 81 men and boys. The force of the blast in the shaft smashed a cage 
and broke all four guide ropes. There were many large roof falls and some of the air doors were reduced to splinters of wood. The 
explosion occurred in a part of the mine called the Arches. Incredibly in this area of the mine naked lights were used to illuminate 
the roadways, however because it was the main intake with good ventilation the naked flames were considered to be safe.

<p>By 1893 the workings of Nos. 1 and 2 pits became extended so the company decided to sink No. 3 pit, which was nearer the reserves 
about a mile further up the valley. From the Inspector of Mines list 1896, there were 1262 employed at Maerdy Nos. 1 and 2 pits, with 
a further 225 employed at No. 3 pit. No. 4 pit was added near to No. 3 in 1914. In 1932 it was 
<img src="Maerdy34 Pits1939.jpg" width="546" height="340" alt="Maerdy, Numbers 3 and 4 Pits 1939" border="0" align="right">taken over 
by the Bwllfa and Cwmaman Collieries Ltd. and coal production ceased at Maerdy at Nos. 1 and 2 the same year. Nos. 3 and 4 pits 
ceased production in 1940 but were kept open for maintenance only.

<p>After the nationalisation of the collieries in 1947 the National Coal Board spent Â£5 million completely reconstructing the colliery 
including a new surface layout and a new horizon mining system underground. Also a link was made with the Bwllfa No. 1 pit workings 
over two miles away at the head of the Dare valley. During the mid 1970's a workforce of 1,120 men were producing 253,000 tons of coal yearly from the Gorllwyn and No. 1 yard seams. Maerdy the last deep mine in the Rhondda valley closed in 1985.
