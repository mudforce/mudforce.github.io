<h3>The Hills of Plymouth</h3>
<p>Richard Hill had been manager of the Plymouth works for <a href="Bacon.htm">Anthony Bacon</a>. On the death of his iron master, he leased the works from Thomas Bacon. His aim was to produce iron of the highest quality, and this he succeeded in doing so successfully that the metal produced at Plymouth was considered to be the finest in South Wales. He encouraged his workmen to take pride in their work, and their welfare was one of his greatest concerns. In 1807 he erected new furnaces at Pentrebach. He was always searching for highly skilled workmen who would help him achieve his goal of producing the finest iron. When he died in 1818, his sons Richard and Anthony became the owners of the works. Anthony was a keen scientist and pursued the policy adopted by his father. As a result, the rails made at Plymouth always commanded a higher price than those made elsewhere. The process for converting pig iron into malleable iron,which was perfected by <a class=link href="bessemer.htm">Bessemer</a>, was partially developed by Anthony Hill.

<p>The works increased in size and, to cope with the orders received, new furnaces were erected at Plymouth, Duffryn and at Pentrebach. In 1844, the year of his brother's death, difficulties connected with the use of water power compelled Anthony Hill to introduce steam power.

<p>As an advocate of education he founded a National School at Pentrebach, and set aside a sum of money to enable needy children to recieve advanced education.

<p>Anthony Hill died in 1862, and the works were purchased by Messrs.Fothergill, Hankey, and Bateman. Beset with financial problems the Plymouth works were finally closed in 1880.</p>
